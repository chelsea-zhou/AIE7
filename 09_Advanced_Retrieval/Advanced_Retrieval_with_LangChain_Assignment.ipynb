For example, some were unaware their loans had been transferred to different servicers or were not notified when repayment was supposed to start.\\n\\n2. **Difficulty with repayment options:** Several individuals faced limited options like forbearance or deferment, which led to accumulating interest and increasing the total debt. Some felt these options extended the repayment period and made paying off the loans more difficult.\\n\\n3. **Financial hardships and inability to afford payments:** Many borrowers indicated that increasing payments to reduce principal was unaffordable, especially given stagnant wages, inflation, or other financial hardships. This made repayment seem unmanageable.\\n\\n4. **Problems with loan servicing practices:** Complaints include issues like being unable to apply extra payments to principal, servicers applying payments primarily to interest, or being placed on long-term forbearance without proper handling, which prolonged debt.\\n\\n5. **Borrower misunderstandings or lack of information:** Some borrowers were unaware of their repayment obligations, or how interest and balances accrue, leading to unintentional delinquencies or credit issues.\\n\\n6. **Errors and mismanagement:** Complaints also involve incorrect reporting of late payments, inability to access account information, or transfer of loans without proper notification, contributing to difficulties in managing loan repayment.\\n\\nIn summary, failure to repay was often due to a combination of inadequate communication, financial constraints, complex or unfavorable servicing practices, and administrative errors.'"

        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",

The representative I spoke to from Nelnet ( XX/XX/XXXX ) had informed me that I was delinquent 140+ days, but that doesn't make sense. That means I was supposed to start repaying in XX/XX/XXXX, but before my loan switched over from great lakes to Nelnet, It said that I did not have to pay until sometime XXXX. As a result of this, my credit score dropped 165 points. This is after 10 years of credit history never missing a payment. Something must be done about this.

I requested a written explanation for the adjustment, but was informed that this was not something they could provide. \\nI am deeply concerned by these unauthorized modifications. If I had not been closely monitoring my account, I might not have noticed these changes. Reducing my AutoPay amount without consent could potentially extend the term of my loan and increase the total interest I pay over time, which feels misleading and unfair.\\n\\nI would appreciate a formal, written explanation of why these changes occurred and what steps are being taken at the Bureau level to monitor Nelnet to ensure this does not happen again without my consent.\", 'My loan was placed in deferment for the month of XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX.

That is absolutely outrageous to charge me that much, considering I'm not even being sent payments until next year.\\n\\n2.

I've tried to research the actual payments through the federal aid website and can't find any payments I've made to them. They're claiming I've paid less than {$2000.00} total. When I've contacted student aid they refuse to help me claiming Nelnet needs to do it when Nelnet is the literal problem.\", 'Nelnet can not why my balance is increasing while in forbearance. Or at least I think their incorrect and blowing me off. First I was told my balance was increasing due to interest. I questioned how its increasing due to interest while my account is in forbearance period. The next response was my account is ineligible for forbearance over a period therefore I received interest charges. \\nIn XXXX I received an email from Nelnet stating my account was going into forbearance and would be at a 0 % interest. \\nAt this point I dont trust anything in regards to my loans and would like supporting documents to confirm everything along with a credit for fraudulent charges.', \"My credit score recently dropped XXXX points because of a miscommunication with NelNet. The automatic payments on my loans had paused in 2020 but didn't automatically turn back on - apparently I had to manually reactivate them which I was unaware of. I believe a letter was sent out stating this but it went to an old address on file ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) so we never received it.

I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position.

Based on the complaints and concerns raised by customers, possible reasons include:\\n\\n1. Administrative Delays: Updating account status, processing payments, and adjusting forbearance periods may involve manual or system-based delays within Nelnet's internal processes.\\n\\n2. Communication Gaps: Some customers report not receiving timely notices or letters confirming the end of forbearance or the restart of payments, which can create delays in updating account status.\\n\\n3. System Errors or Inconsistencies: Customers have experienced issues where interest charges continued during forbearance or payments were not reflected correctly, indicating potential technical or procedural issues.\\n\\n4. Changes in Loan Servicing: Transfers of accounts between different servicers (e.g., from Great Lakes to Nelnet) have caused confusion, delays, and inaccurate account reporting.\\n\\n5. Regulatory or Court Orders: Certain forbearance actions based on court orders or federal rulings may have additional procedural steps before updates are fully implemented.\\n\\nOverall, these factors can contribute to Nelnet taking longer than expected to reflect payment changes after forbearance.

We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans. As advised on XX/XX/XXXX, we are unable to process the plan due to the court injunction.

It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days.

Some loans were paused but some were still steadily accruing while the forbearance period hasn't ended yet. I'm at a lost and don't know where I can go to get help for this.

It was denied without notice, and without telling me why. I found out about this on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately applied again. However, since I was never told why my first application was denied, I didn\\'t know if I needed to fix or change anything on my second application. After my first application, my loans were automatically put into processing forbearance. After my second application, they were not. I messaged to ask them to please put them into processing forbearance several times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), and only received generic and irrelevant messages in response. I\\'m also serving an XXXX term and am eligible for my loans to be in forbearance due to that.

I was able to apply through XXXX, and it took them XXXX days to approve the request, but when they did they only approved it for XXXX of my loans. I want them ALL in forbearance. In the meantime, due to the processing pause on XXXX applications, their website had a notification that said, \" If you have an IDR application that has not been processed within XXXX days and have an unpaid bill within XXXX days of the due date, MOHELA will automatically place a processing forbearance as directed by Federal Student Aid to your account. No action is required by you. \\'\\' This applies to me. So I was waiting for my loans to be put into forbearance but they never were. My bill was well over ten days past due, and still nothing. I paid the bill out of fear for my credit score, but this is completely unacceptable. If no action is required by me, why am I having to message them twice about it ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) only for nothing to happen? I have sent them five messages total ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) about this whole fiasco, and have never had a helpful response, if I received one at all. The three responses I have gotten ( the dates of which I\\'m unsure of because they don\\'t contain a timestamp, which at this point feels purposeful and malicious ) have been an obviously copy and pasted default answer in response to the words \" XXXX \\'\\' or \" forbearance \\'\\' and do not at all relate to my specific questions and situation.

The stakes here are very high, and they continue to drop the ball and they can not be trusted.

It\\'s been replaced with one that says \" Borrows that have a pending IDR application may also be placed on a forbearance until no later than XX/XX/XXXX. \\'\\' So which one is it? They can not claim to be automatically putting loans into forbearance in one notification, and then say that it\\'s only a possibility in another one.

However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans.

It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This was supposedly \" resolved \\'\\' by the company in my last CFPB complaint - but I recently received a notification stating my account is being removed from forbearance ( 0 % interest and no payments until more information is available ) effective XX/XX/XXXX - even though forbearance has largely been extended to all SAVE applicants and enrollees due to the current changes made by the administration.'], reference_contexts=['Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing.

Based on the complaints data, many borrowers face similar issues where servicers have provided verbal assurances but failed to provide official written proof or smooth customer support.\\n\\nHere are some points to consider:\\n\\n1. **Lack of Written Confirmation:** Many complaints highlight that borrowers are told verbally about extended forbearance periods or protections, but they do not receive official documentation or in writing. This can make it difficult to prove your status if needed for disputes or future reference.\\n\\n2. **Trouble Logging In or Getting Help:** A common issue reported is difficulty accessing accounts online and long wait times when calling customer service. Some reports mention being repeatedly transferred or unable to speak with a representative, which can hinder your ability to verify your loan status.\\n\\n3. **Possible Reasons for Your Situation:**\\n   - Sometimes, servicers may have verbal assurances but delay or fail to update their records properly.\\n   - The online login issues could be due to account access problems, system outages, or updates on their end.\\n   - The long wait times and disconnections suggest limited customer service capacity, especially during complex periods like ongoing litigation affecting loan programs.\\n\\n4. **What You Can Do:**\\n   - Continue attempting to log in regularly and consider requesting official documentation of your forbearance or loan status via email or certified mail.\\n   - Document every interaction: note dates and times of calls, screenshots of account access issues, and any email correspondence.\\n   - File a formal dispute or complaint with your loan servicer requesting written confirmation of your in-forbearance status until 2040.\\n   - If customer service remains unresponsive, consider reaching out to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) or your state’s student loan ombudsman for additional support.\\n\\nIn summary, many borrowers face similar frustrations with verification and support.

Reporting me delinquent while in active repayment plan review appears to violate this principle.

For example, claims that delinquency was reported while loans were in forbearance or during active repayment plan reviews suggest violations of the requirement to report accurate and verified information.\\n\\n2. **Failure to Respond to Disputes:** Multiple complaints state that EdFinancial did not respond to dispute attempts or failed to correct previously reported inaccuracies, which violates their obligation under the FCRA to investigate and update credit reports when consumers challenge the information.\\n\\n3. **Unauthorized Disclosure of Personal Information:** Some complaints allege that EdFinancial shared personal financial data with credit bureaus without proper consent, violating laws that govern privacy (such as FERPA) and the FCRA’s requirement for authorized and verifiable information sharing.\\n\\n4. **Reporting Without Proper Authorization:** Some complaints highlight that EdFinancial reported information related to student loans without explicit consumer consent or proper authorization, which conflicts with statutory requirements that furnishers of credit information ensure reporting accuracy and legitimacy.\\n\\nHow your experience with teacher loan forgiveness paperwork supports your concern:\\n\\nYour experience with submitting teacher loan forgiveness paperwork that was mishandled or not acknowledged properly indicates a pattern of administrative errors and improper reporting. Specifically:\\n\\n- If EdFinancial failed to process or respond correctly to forgiveness requests, it could lead to inaccurate credit reporting (e.g., incorrectly reported delinquency or default status).\\n- Mishandling such paperwork suggests lapses in compliance with federal laws requiring accurate and timely reporting of borrower information.\\n- If they reported delinquency or default while your forgiveness application was pending or approved, that would be a violation of the obligation to report accurate and current data as mandated by the FCRA and related statutes.\\n\\nIn summary, your experience shows potential violations of the FCRA by EdFinancial due to inaccurate account reporting, failure to investigate disputes, and possible improper sharing of your personal information.

In addition, the Department of Education, by failing to prevent such a breach, has defaulted on its contractual duties, materially violating the terms of agreement I entered into as a borrower. As a matter of contract law, this breach voids the contract in its entirety, rendering all outstanding balances unenforceable. The contract is no longer valid and therefore all associated reporting must cease immediately. \\n\\nFurthermore, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), consumer reporting agencies are required to report only information that is complete and verifiable.

I have received multiple confirmations that I have been set up for auto-debit and then NelNet deletes the record.

Please assist me in correcting this behavior, so that other borrowers are not informed of an auto-debit only to have these bad actors play games with our loan accounts.\"], response=\"NelNet's dual role as both the loan servicer responsible for reporting student loan accounts to credit bureaus and as the entity managing auto-debit payments can pose significant legal and financial risks for borrowers. Here’s how:\\n\\n1. **Potential for Inaccurate or Improper Reporting:**  \\n   As the entity reporting loan account statuses to credit bureaus, NelNet has the power to influence borrowers’ credit scores. However, complaints indicate instances where NelNet has reported delinquencies, late payments, or account statuses without proper verification or due to servicing errors. This can lead to unjust credit score declines, harming borrowers’ ability to obtain new credit or loans.\\n\\n2. **Faulty Payment Processing and Auto-Debit Management:**  \\n   NelNet handles auto-debit payments, but recurring issues such as failure to process payments correctly, misapplication of payments, or loss of access to online accounts can result in missed or late payments being incorrectly reported. This not only damages credit scores but also increases the risk of unnecessary collections and penalties.\\n\\n3. **Privacy Violations and Unauthorized Access:**  \\n   Allegations of privacy breaches, unauthorized account access, and data leaks raise serious concerns. Unauthorized access to personal and financial information violates privacy rights under FERPA and other laws, exposing borrowers to identity theft and fraud. Such breaches undermine trust and can cause financial harm if personal data is exploited.\\n\\n4. **Failure to Correct Errors and Lack of Transparency:**  \\n   Several complaints highlight NelNet’s refusal or failure to correct inaccurate account information, settle accounts after payments or agreements have been made, or provide proper documentation. This can result in continued inaccurate reporting, wrongful debts, and financial harm.\\n\\n5. **Legal Risks and Regulatory Enforcement:**  \\n   The combination of improper reporting, privacy violations, and mishandling of payments exposes NelNet to regulatory actions under laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), and data security regulations. Borrowers may seek legal remedies, further regulatory scrutiny, and sanctions.\\n\\n**In summary:**  \\nNelNet’s role in reporting and payment management creates a conflict of interest where errors, misreporting, or privacy violations directly impact borrowers’ financial health and legal rights. Recurring issues with payment processing and alleged privacy breaches heighten the risk of financial harm, including unjust credit damage, unauthorized account activity, and potential exposure to identity theft, which collectively point to systemic risks needing regulatory oversight and improved accountability.\", multi_responses=None, reference=\"NelNet, as the loan servicer, is responsible for furnishing student loan account information to credit bureaus and managing borrowers' payment processes, including auto-debit enrollments. According to the provided context, NelNet is implicated in two major areas of concern. First, in the legal demand letter (<1-hop>), NelNet is identified as the originating furnisher of student loan data that is allegedly being reported in violation of federal privacy statutes and consumer protection laws, due to unauthorized access and breaches of contract. This exposes NelNet to liability for continuing to report or furnish data that is now under legal dispute, potentially causing reputational and financial harm to borrowers whose contracts are considered void due to these breaches. Second, in the borrower’s account (<2-hop>), NelNet is described as repeatedly failing to process auto-debit payments despite providing confirmation, deleting payment records from their website, and potentially denying borrowers the small discount associated with auto-payment. This not only creates financial inconvenience but may also result in inaccurate reporting of payment status to credit bureaus, further harming borrowers’ credit standing.

This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \\n\\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \\n\\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \\n\\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \\n\\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.', 'Thank you for reviewing my concerns.

Despite this, Aidvantage incorrectly relied on a XX/XX/XXXX graduation date, as reported in an earlier data transfer, and initiated repayment with a due date of XXXX XXXXwithout verifying the updated NSLDS information. This misalignment led to the wrongful early start of my repayment period. \\n\\nI proactively worked with the University of Georgia to correct the record. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Senior Assistant Registrar, confirmed that UGA  manually updated the graduation date in the NSLDS Clearinghouse to reflect my summer XXXX graduation term. This means Aidvantage has access to the correct data and still failed to adjust my grace period or repayment terms accordingly. \\n\\nAidvantages statement that \" there is no negative reporting \\'\\' is misleading. While they may not have marked payments as formally delinquent, the incorrect repayment start date has affected the accounts age, status, and monthly payment history, which are critical components of credit scoring models used by mortgage underwriters, financial institutions, etc. The impact is not limited to delinquencyaccuracy matters. \\n\\nDespite calls and emails, including my direct outreach to my assigned representative, XXXX, I have not received confirmation that : Aidvantage received and processed the corrected NSLDS data ; My grace period has been properly reinstated ; My repayment start date has been realigned with the correct graduation date ; My credit file has been updated to reflect these changes. \\n\\nUnder the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), furnishers of credit information have a legal obligation to report accurate and complete information.

For example, the consumer who set up autopay through AidVantage confirmed autopay was managed with autopay confirmed, yet a past due status appeared without notification. This suggests that the reporting is inaccurate or incomplete due to failure in proper client communication and record-keeping.\\n\\n2. **Incorrect and Outdated Information:**  \\n   Many complaints highlight that AidVantage reported delinquency, late payments, or account statuses that were either improper, based on outdated address data, or during periods where reporting was explicitly restricted (e.g., during the Department of Education\\'s \"On-Ramp\" protection period). For example, some consumers state that missed payments occurred during protected periods when they shouldn\\'t have been reported, and others point out consistent misreporting of their account status or payment history.\\n\\n3. **Failure to Verify or Validate Debt and Account Legitimacy:**  \\n   Several complaints allege that AidVantage has failed to provide evidence of valid ownership or servicing rights, especially following the Department of Education\\'s abolishment, rendering certain debts and their reporting legally questionable. For example, claims cite the failure to verify the legitimacy of the debt post-abolishment and continued collection efforts on accounts that are now legally void or unverified.\\n\\n4. **Violation of Fair Credit Reporting and Debt Collection Laws:**  \\n   Complaints note violations of the FCRA and FDCPA—including reporting incorrect information, failing to investigate disputes properly, and continuing collections on legally void debt. The consumer narratives mention that the inaccurate reporting impacts credit scores, mortgage eligibility, and personal finances adversely.\\n\\n5. **Breach of Contract and Breach of Fiduciary Duty:**  \\n   The management of the loans through AidVantage, despite autopay confirmation, resulted in delinquent states without appropriate notification, breaching the expected obligations to communicate and accurately report account status. The subsequent breach of contract claims involving the Department of Education and associated agencies further undermine the credibility of the tradeline’s accuracy and validity.\\n\\n**In summary:**  \\nThe pattern of improper notification, misreporting of outdated or incorrect account information, and ongoing collection efforts on potentially void or unverified debts collectively create a strong case for considering the tradeline\\'s removal. These issues suggest the tradeline may be based on inaccurate, incomplete, or legally questionable data, justifying its removal from the credit report until proper verification and correction can be made.', multi_responses=None, reference='The issues collectively support the argument for removal of the tradeline from the credit report as follows: First, the Department of Education loans were managed through AidVantage, with autopay set up and confirmed via email, yet the account still showed as past due without any notification that autopay was incomplete.

The disputes mention potential violations of these laws due to unauthorized access, mishandling, or sharing of student data, which undermine individuals' privacy rights.\\n\\n2. **Credit Reporting and Data Accuracy**: The FCRA governs how consumer credit information is collected, used, and reported. The recent CFPB findings highlight improper or unverified investigations by credit bureaus, leading to inaccurate or unverifiable reports. This is directly relevant to the student loan disputes, where inaccurate reporting or failure to rectify errors compounds the violation of consumers' rights.\\n\\n3. **Accountability and Legal Violations**: The CFPB's recent crackdown emphasizes holding credit reporting agencies accountable for failing to properly investigate disputes or verify information, which can prolong inaccuracies on credit reports and violate consumers’ rights. Similarly, the disputes involve allegations of breaches of contracts and violations of privacy laws (FERPA, HIPAA), emphasizing the importance of lawful handling of sensitive data.\\n\\n4. **Remedial Actions and Data Integrity**: Both the CFPB's enforcement actions and the student loan complaints seek remedial actions—correcting inaccuracies, deleting wrongful data, and ensuring future compliance—highlighting a shared goal of protecting consumers' data integrity and rights.\\n\\nIn summary, the CFPB's recent findings underscore the importance of proper investigation, verification, and safeguarding of consumer data. These findings relate directly to the student loan disputes because they highlight systemic issues in how sensitive data—whether under the FCRA, FERPA, or HIPAA—is handled, and the necessity for accountability and legal compliance to protect consumers from data mishandling, breaches, and related rights violations.\", multi_responses=None, reference='The recent findings by the CFPB highlight that certain credit reporting agencies, such as XXXX and XXXX, failed to conduct proper and reasonable investigations into disputed credit report items, as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).

Because of litigation I was automatically placed in a XXXX level repayment plan which I never selected and which isnt XXXX so it wont count towards XXXX.

I also cant enter an XXXX plan even if I want to because there is a processing pause. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX a Mohela supervisor extended my forbearance for XXXX year through XX/XX/XXXX so I did not have to call back each month. This helped me avoid making payments on a plan that would not count towards XXXX. I have a recording of this conversation. She also helped me submit a paper application for a new XXXX plan, but said she could not guarantee when this would be processed due to the pause, but in the meanwhile I would be in forbearance so I wouldn\\'t have to worry.

That supervisor explained that if my application is not approved before my next payment date of XX/XX/XXXX, I can call to be placed on processing forbearance. She understood that I did not want to make payments that were not in an XXXX plan because they would not qualify for XXXX. She said the processing forbearance wont be done automatically, but at that point I can call and ask because theyll see the new XXXX application on file.

Based on the complaints and information available, Nelnet or other loan servicers like MOHELA may take some time to process and update your account after a forbearance is granted. This delay can occur because they need to verify the forbearance status, update their systems, and ensure that your account reflects the correct payment status.\\n\\nSpecifically, delays might be due to:\\n- Processing delays related to administrative or technical backlogs.\\n- The need for manual updates or verification, especially if forbearance was granted through conversations or administrative actions that require system updates.\\n- Complications arising from ongoing applications or court rulings, such as injunctions or hold-ups caused by litigation (as mentioned in the complaints).\\n\\nAdditionally, if there have been issues with communication, long hold times, or system pauses (like processing pauses mentioned in complaints), these can further extend the time it takes to update your payment status.\\n\\nIn your case, the long waiting periods and slow updates could be due to these systemic and procedural delays, which are unfortunately common with some loan servicers during busy periods or complex administrative processes. If you're experiencing ongoing issues or delays, contacting your servicer regularly and requesting written confirmation of your forbearance status can sometimes help. However, given the complaints' context, these delays are often a matter of internal processing times beyond your immediate control.\\n\\nIf the delay persists or your account shows past due status incorrectly, I recommend continuing to follow up with your servicer and documenting all communications.

It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit.

Who Can Access the Information : The privacy act outlines that access to your information is authorized for : Federal, state, or local agencies ( but these agencies must have a legitimate purpose as defined under law or regulation ). \\n\\nSpecific private parties ( like financial institutions, guaranty agencies, and educational institutions ) under controlled circumstances ( e.g., loan servicing, fraud investigation ). \\n\\nConsumer reporting agencies for credit-related purposes or loan delinquency tracking. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX DOGE ( Department of Government Efficiency ) does not fall into any of these categories. Specifically, there is no legal or formal authorization for DOGE or its personnel to access or handle educational loan records from the Department of Education. DOGE is not listed as an authorized agency or party under the Master Promissory Note 's routine uses. This means that any action by DOGE, including accessing or disclosing loan-related information, would violate the terms set forth in this agreement and would be an unauthorized disclosure. \\n\\n2. No Explicit Authorization for DOGE or XXXXXXXX XXXX : The privacy statement does not list DOGE or any organization associated with XXXX XXXX as a permissible third party. The language about disclosures specifies agencies and institutions involved in loan servicing, fraud prevention, and collection efforts, but DOGE is not among them. Additionally, DOGE is not a government agency that could be granted access to federal records like the Department of Educations student loan data. \\n\\n3. Legitimate Purposes : The passage details the legitimate purposes for data access and disclosure, such as fraud investigation, verifying eligibility, loan servicing, and collections. DOGE does not have a recognized legal or institutional role within these processes. Unless DOGE had been explicitly granted a role by an appropriate federal authority ( which has not been documented or authorized ), they would have no legal standing to access educational records, including loan records under the Master Promissory Note. \\n\\n4. Violation of FERPA and Privacy Act : The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) also protects educational records from unauthorized access, and based on the information in your complaint, its clear that DOGEs actions likely violated FERPA as well. FERPA limits access to student records without the student 's written consent, except in specific circumstances ( such as disclosures to specific educational officials or authorized third parties ). XXXX XXXX, acting through DOGE, did not have the necessary authorization under FERPA to access these records. \\n\\n5. Absence of Transparency on Data Usage : Since there is no clear or documented disclosure allowing DOGE to access or utilize the educational records, it would be safe to say that DOGEs actions likely constitute a violation of not just the Master Promissory Note 's terms but also of privacy and security regulations set out by the Department of Education and relevant federal laws. \\n\\nConclusion : The privacy act of 1974 you from our Master Promissory Note outlines the specific and authorized uses of personal information related to student loans, none of which includes access by DOGE. Therefore, XXXX XXXX XXXX had no legitimate or legal authority to access the Department of Educations records, and their actions represent a clear violation of the terms of the Master Promissory Note, as well as possibly violating federal laws like FERPA and the Privacy Act. \\n\\nReference Information below How XXXX XXXX DOGE Took Over the Education Department, One Office at a Time Published : Wed, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX EST Updated : Wed, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX EST XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Inside DOGE 's Takeover of the Education Department Staffers at the Department of Education worry the Department of Government Efficiency is accessing sensitive information and spreading confusion. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX Says Department of Education No Longer Exists XXXX XXXX XXXX\", 'In XXXX I attended XXXX XXXX located in XXXX CA, Once I XXXX  i began making payments to my loan.

Im upset because i spend Almost XXXX XXXX dollar on the loan to a school that is not valid and they kept my money. What can i do in this situation.', 'To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute my student loan debt and request full cancellation of my outstanding balance. This request is based on the violation of my rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), which protects the privacy of student education records, including personal and financial information.\\n\\nMy data was compromised and improperly disclosed, constituting a serious breach of FERPA. This violation not only undermines the legitimacy of the loan servicing process in my case but also contributes to the broader pattern of misconduct already established against XXXX. \\n\\nI am aware of the lawsuit filed against XXXX  by various state attorneys general and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which accused the company of deceptive practices, including steering borrowers into costly forbearance, misrepresenting payment options, and failing to provide clear and accurate information. These findings further support my position that the management of my loans has been unlawful and unethical. \\n\\nRecently, I noticed a significant decrease in my credit scoreover XXXX pointsand upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered that my student loan account was reported in a misleading and inaccurate manner. \\n\\nI have been enrolled in an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan for several years, which should not negatively impact my credit score. However, the account has been reported as if it was in default, which is false and does not reflect my current repayment status. As per the guidelines of the IDR plan, the loan should not be reported as negative on my credit report, but it has been, causing significant harm to my credit standing. \\n\\nIt appears that this misreporting is due to XXXX inaccurate reporting practices, and I believe this issue is tied to the ongoing legal matters involving XXXX, which were recently publicized.', 'Subject : Follow-Up to CFPB Complaint # XXXX Discrepancies, Fraud Concerns, and Inadequate Validation of Federal Loan To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to submit an updated and urgent follow-up to my complaint under case number XXXX regarding an alleged student loan serviced by Aidvantage. \\n\\nWhile the loan is claimed to fall under the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I have received a Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) as validation, I must emphasize that this documentation does not adequately validate the debt as legally mine for the following reasons : 1. Name Discrepancy and Identity Concerns The MPN Aidvantage provided lists the name \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\', which does not match my legal name, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX used in all my official and financial documentation, including Secretary of State records . \\nThis inconsistency raises a serious concern regarding potential identity confusion or fraud, particularly in light of historical fraud issues related to XXXX XXXX, where this loan is allegedly connected. \\n\\n2. MPN Is Not Sufficient Debt Validation While the MPN is a required form under federal student loan programs, it does not, by itself, prove current ownership, standing, or servicing rights. It is a general form that anyone with identifying information could potentially sign, and does not : Prove I signed it, Confirm my consent to this specific loan, Show that the debt is still owed and collectible, or XXXX Aidvantage as a legal party authorized to collect.\\n\\nFederal law requires debt collectors including federal loan servicers to validate debts upon dispute, especially where there are concerns of fraud, identity mismatch, or payment errors. \\n\\n3. Potential Fraud and Misrepresentation The MPN itself states under False Certification and Unauthorized Payments that borrowers may be discharged from loan obligations in cases of : Identity theft, Falsified signatures, Fraudulent certification by the school, and Situations where the borrower did not attend the school or did not benefit from the program. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX the institution linked to this loan has a documented history of irregularities and possible fraud. Given the time period ( XXXX ), and that I attended for only six months and understood the balance was paid in full, I am asserting my right to request : A full and itemized payment history, Proof of loan disbursement, Verification of the identity and authorization used to originate the loan, and A statement confirming Aidvantages legal servicing rights. \\n\\n4. Right to Dispute and Protection Under Federal Law As a borrower, I am protected by federal law, including : The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) ( where applicable ), The Higher Education Act of 1965, and The Federal Trade Commission Act, particularly in cases involving potential misrepresentation or fraud. \\n\\nRequested Actions : I request that the CFPB compel Aidvantage to provide : Full documentation verifying that the loan is connected to my legal identity ( XXXX XXXX ) ; Clear proof of loan disbursement and servicing rights ; A complete transaction and payment history ; Documentation to confirm the loan remains valid and unpaid ; and A response to the possibility of false certification or identity misuse under federal loan discharge conditions. \\n\\nWithout this verification, I do not acknowledge this debt as legitimate or collectible. \\n\\nThank you for your time and advocacy in helping ensure transparency and borrower protections.'], reference_contexts=['My personal and financial data was compromised violating FERPA.

In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \\n\\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \\n\\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account.

On XX/XX/XXXX, DOGE agents took control of the Departments internal systems, locking out employees and members of Congress. This lockout was widely covered by major news outlets, including XXXX, XXXX, and other prominent stations. During this unauthorized access, it remains unclear exactly what actions were taken or what specific records or data were accessed, altered, or taken during that time. \\n\\nThis breach directly impacted my personally identifiable education records, which are maintained by XXXXXXXX XXXX, the U.S. Department of Education, and service providers such as XXXX ( which handles federal student loan servicing ). These records include my academic transcripts, enrollment history, and borrower-related information linked to the federal student loans taken out by my parent XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on my behalf. \\n\\nThe unauthorized access and potential misuse of these records constitutes a violation of several laws, including : Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), which protects the privacy of student education records. The unauthorized disclosure of my education records and personal information is a direct violation of FERPA. \\n\\nThe Privacy Act of 1974, which safeguards personal information held by federal agencies. The breach by DOGE agents violates the protections established by this law, as they accessed personal and educational data without authorization. \\n\\nThe Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act, which criminalizes the unauthorized use of personal information. Given the potential for misuse of my financial and educational records, this may be applicable to the actions taken by DOGE and XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nGiven that DOGE is not a legitimate government agency, and XXXX XXXX holds no official authority within either XXXXXXXX XXXX or the Department of Education, this action was entirely unauthorized. The breach of my records, as well as the potential misuse of my parents loan information, is a serious violation of privacy and security. \\n\\nI demand an immediate and thorough investigation into the actions taken during this security breach, including identifying what specific data was accessed or stolen, and any potential misuse of both my personal information and my parents financial records. I expect a prompt response detailing the actions being taken to rectify this situation and ensure that such a breach does not happen again. Removal loans off both my credit report and my parents credit ( XXXX XXXX ) report from any reference to this loan or associated financial obligations, as there is uncertainty about the authenticity of the information. This should include the deletion of any and all records related to the loan from both parties credit history, to prevent long-term damage to our financial standing. This should also be communicated to the credit bureaus XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. \\n\\nAccording to the Privacy act Located in our Master Promissory Note ( attachment provided ) 1. Who Can Access the Information : The privacy act outlines that access to your information is authorized for : Federal, state, or local agencies ( but these agencies must have a legitimate purpose as defined under law or regulation ). \\n\\nSpecific private parties ( like financial institutions, guaranty agencies, and educational institutions ) under controlled circumstances ( e.g., loan servicing, fraud investigation ). \\n\\nConsumer reporting agencies for credit-related purposes or loan delinquency tracking. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX DOGE ( Department of Government Efficiency ) does not fall into any of these categories. Specifically, there is no legal or formal authorization for DOGE or its personnel to access or handle educational loan records from the Department of Education. DOGE is not listed as an authorized agency or party under the Master Promissory Note 's routine uses. This means that any action by DOGE, including accessing or disclosing loan-related information, would violate the terms set forth in this agreement and would be an unauthorized disclosure. \\n\\n2. No Explicit Authorization for DOGE or XXXXXXXX XXXX : The privacy statement does not list DOGE or any organization associated with XXXX XXXX as a permissible third party. The language about disclosures specifies agencies and institutions involved in loan servicing, fraud prevention, and collection efforts, but DOGE is not among them. Additionally, DOGE is not a government agency that could be granted access to federal records like the Department of Educations student loan data. \\n\\n3. Legitimate Purposes : The passage details the legitimate purposes for data access and disclosure, such as fraud investigation, verifying eligibility, loan servicing, and collections. DOGE does not have a recognized legal or institutional role within these processes. Unless DOGE had been explicitly granted a role by an appropriate federal authority ( which has not been documented or authorized ), they would have no legal standing to access educational records, including loan records under the Master Promissory Note. \\n\\n4. Violation of FERPA and Privacy Act : The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) also protects educational records from unauthorized access, and based on the information in your complaint, its clear that DOGEs actions likely violated FERPA as well. FERPA limits access to student records without the student 's written consent, except in specific circumstances ( such as disclosures to specific educational officials or authorized third parties ). XXXX XXXX, acting through DOGE, did not have the necessary authorization under FERPA to access these records. \\n\\n5. Absence of Transparency on Data Usage : Since there is no clear or documented disclosure allowing DOGE to access or utilize the educational records, it would be safe to say that DOGEs actions likely constitute a violation of not just the Master Promissory Note 's terms but also of privacy and security regulations set out by the Department of Education and relevant federal laws. \\n\\nConclusion : The privacy act of 1974 you from our Master Promissory Note outlines the specific and authorized uses of personal information related to student loans, none of which includes access by DOGE.

Please assist me in correcting this behavior, so that other borrowers are not informed of an auto-debit only to have these bad actors play games with our loan accounts.\"], response=\"NelNet's dual roles as both the loan servicer responsible for reporting student loan accounts to credit bureaus and as the entity managing auto-debit payments can pose significant legal and financial risks for borrowers. \\n\\nFirstly, as a loan servicer and credit reporter, NelNet is responsible for accurately reflecting the status of borrower accounts. However, issues such as improper credit reporting—such as reporting late payments or delinquencies that do not reflect current account status—can harm a borrower's credit score and financial reputation. For example, complaints have highlighted instances where NelNet continued to report numerous 90-day late payments despite accounts being in administrative forbearance or current, thus causing unwarranted credit damage.\\n\\nSecondly, as the administrator of auto-debit payments, NelNet's management of automatic withdrawals can lead to prohibited or mistaken payments, missed payments, or payment processing errors. Such errors not only impact a borrower's credit and financial standing but also create potential legal liabilities if the borrower believes payments are wrongly misapplied, withheld, or if unauthorized payments are made.\\n\\nIn addition, there are concerns related to privacy violations. Complaints have surfaced asserting that NelNet, or related entities, may have improperly accessed or mishandled sensitive borrower information, violating laws like FERPA, the Privacy Act of 1974, and federal privacy regulations. Unauthorized access or disclosure could create legal exposure for NelNet, especially if it contributes to identity theft or data breaches.\\n\\nFurthermore, recurring issues with payment processing and inadequate communication during account transitions exacerbate borrower confusion about account status, repayment obligations, and eligibility for deferment or hardship programs. Such miscommunications can lead to unintentional defaults, increased late payments, and thus negative credit reporting.\\n\\nAltogether, the combination of reporting inaccuracies, payment processing errors, potential privacy violations, and inadequate communication creates a landscape where borrowers can suffer legal and financial harm. They might face unwarranted damage to their credit, wrongful collection actions, breach of privacy, or even legal disputes over the validity of their loan debt—especially in cases where alleged privacy violations and data breaches are involved, as some complaints claim improper access to sensitive personal data.\\n\\nIn summary, NelNet's responsibilities in reporting and auto-debit management, coupled with ongoing complaints about privacy violations and payment processing issues, can lead to significant harm for borrowers both financially—through damage to credit and improper debt collection—and legally—due to potential breaches of privacy laws and contractual obligations.\", multi_responses=None, reference=\"NelNet, as the loan servicer, is responsible for furnishing student loan account information to credit bureaus and managing borrowers' payment processes, including auto-debit enrollments. According to the provided context, NelNet is implicated in two major areas of concern. First, in the legal demand letter (<1-hop>), NelNet is identified as the originating furnisher of student loan data that is allegedly being reported in violation of federal privacy statutes and consumer protection laws, due to unauthorized access and breaches of contract. This exposes NelNet to liability for continuing to report or furnish data that is now under legal dispute, potentially causing reputational and financial harm to borrowers whose contracts are considered void due to these breaches.

This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \\n\\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \\n\\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case.

These findings are directly related to the broader issues of breaches of contract and rights violations, including FERPA and HIPAA, in the context of student loan reporting.\\n\\nHere's how they relate:\\n\\n1. **FCRA Violations and Improper Reporting:**  \\n   The CFPB's reports indicate that credit reporting agencies and furnishers, such as XXXX and XXXX XXXX, are failing to comply with their legal obligations to verify and accurately report consumer data. This aligns with cases where student loan information has been improperly reported or remains on credit reports despite disputes, breaches of contractual and legal obligations to maintain accurate data.\\n\\n2. **Data Security and Privacy Violations (FERPA and HIPAA):**  \\n   The disputes mention breaches of federal laws like FERPA and HIPAA. FERPA protects the privacy of student education records, and HIPAA safeguards health information. Unauthorized access or mishandling of sensitive borrower data, as alleged in some complaints, constitutes violations of these statutes. The CFPB's findings about wrongful investigations and reporting failures underscore systemic vulnerabilities that may also facilitate or result from such privacy breaches.\\n\\n3. **Contractual and Legal Responsibilities:**  \\n   When student loan servicers and agencies fail to uphold their contractual duties—such as proper investigation, verification, or safeguarding of data—they breach contractual and statutory obligations. These breaches sometimes lead to the invalidation of contractual relationships (as argued in the complaints), and continuing to report or use invalid data further violates laws like FCRA, which requires information to be complete and verifiable.\\n\\n4. **Impact on Rights and Remedies:**  \\n   The CFPB's findings emphasize the importance of proper investigation and verification, which are fundamental to protecting consumers' rights against unlawful reporting and privacy violations. The cases where borrowers demand deletion of data, accountability, and legal remedies reflect this proactive approach to enforcing rights violations tied to improper investigations and data mishandling.\\n\\n**In summary:**  \\nThe CFPB's recent findings about improper investigations underline the systemic issues leading to violations of laws like the FCRA, FERPA, and HIPAA in the student loan reporting context. These violations involve improper data reporting, breaches of privacy protections, and contractual breaches, all of which undermine borrowers' legal rights and protections.

You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan.

It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed.

The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This was supposedly \" resolved \\'\\' by the company in my last CFPB complaint - but I recently received a notification stating my account is being removed from forbearance ( 0 % interest and no payments until more information is available ) effective XX/XX/XXXX - even though forbearance has largely been extended to all SAVE applicants and enrollees due to the current changes made by the administration.', \"In XXXX, I submitted a complaint to XXXX. \\n\\nI was steered into long term forbearance and deferments.

My loans have been in repayment since XX/XX/XXXX. I was on IBR Plan until XX/XX/XXXX, when I was told to switch to SAVE Plan by my servicer EDFinancial. I was thrown into forbearance status XX/XX/XXXX, with no clear explanation, or options given. I read in XX/XX/XXXX that I should be allowed to go back on IBR Plan. I tried to switch back to IBR, and not be in forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX. I called EDFinancial and asked about going back to IBR XX/XX/XXXX. I was told I could, and the woman I spoke with asked my income and household size, said Id get an email. I didnt receive any correspondence from EDFinancial. I got on students.gov account and filled out an IDR app XX/XX/XXXX, requesting to go back onto IBR. That application status is still in review to date. The IDR forgiveness tracker graph on the students.gov account said I had a little over 2 years left of repayment, until I reached enough payments for IDR forgiveness. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and was told all IDR apps were put on hold because of an injunction with SAVE Plan. I asked why IBR was being impacted, since its not SAVE. There are 5 IDR plans, not just SAVE. I received no resolve with my application. Around this time, the IDR application form was removed from the Dept of ED website, which was really concerning. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and inquired about my IBR app again. I also requested a copy of my MPN. I called EDFinancial again XX/XX/XXXX as id not received the copy of my MPN, and to ask about my IBR app. I was told theyd mailed the MPN, it was sent out. I received an email notification from student aid.gov that said IDR apps would start getting processed again to contact your servicer, I believe this was around XX/XX/XXXX. I logged onto student aid.gov XX/XX/XXXX, and notice the graph for the IDR plan forgiveness payments had disappeared from my account homepage. I called students.gov, and she denied knowing anything about what IDR forgiveness info I was talking about, she told me to call my servicer for information on my loans. She told me I also had to keep filling out a new IDR app every time they paused and restarting processing the applications. I was in shock a bit. I then called EDFinancial to ask about my IDR app ( again ). A woman spoke with me. I asked if my IDR ( IBR ) app was any closer to being processed. She said theyre behind, and its taking a long time. She told me the apps have been put on hold three times beginning XX/XX/XXXX with the last time they started processing the apps again was XX/XX/XXXX. She put me on hold when I asked what happened to my IDR repayment forgiveness tracker info that was on my students.gov account. She returned, and told me that as of Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) the Dept of Ed told EDFinancial they were not allowed to discuss IDR forgiveness payments with borrowers. I said that was preposterous, and I asked for a statement of how many months if been in repayment. I was told a statement of my payments would be mailed, and could take up to 15 days. I also asked for a copy of my MPN ( for the third time ). I asked why Id not received it, after asking for it twice already. She said it was mailed to me XX/XX/XXXX. She told me shed ask for another copy of my MPN to get mailed to me, and it would also take up to 15 days. She told me I should be able to see it on my studentaid.gov account. I asked why I can not access it on my EDFinancial account. I can not access it on my students.gov account, either. It says theres no record of my MPN on my studentaid.gov account. I asked her why my IBR application was still not processed as its been almost 3 months since I submitted it. Ive been in forbearance for 9 months when I shouldve been in repayment due to no fault of my own, a court injunction with 1 of 5 available repayment options is causing this issue. I also read that the court may have had an opinion on ICR and PAYE. This still has nothing to do with IBR or PSLF. I can not get a copy of my XXXX from EDFinancial, and it says there is not record of if on my studentaid.gov account. My IDR repayment information has been disappeared from my students.gov account, and I was told by EDFinancial that they could not talk to anyone about IDR forgiveness or payments that had been made to count towards that ( by the DOE on XX/XX/XXXX ). This doesnt seem legal. Its really confusing bouncing back and forth between the Dept of ed ( students.gov ) and EDFinancial. I graduated in XX/XX/XXXX. Ive been in repayment since XX/XX/XXXX.

Based on the complaint details, here are some key points that might clarify why you're saying you’re in forbearance until 2040 but haven't received any written confirmation or help logging in:\\n\\n1. **Forbearance Periods and Communications:**  \\n   Several complaints mention that borrowers were told they were in forbearance until a certain date (like 2040) but never received official documentation confirming this. Some borrowers reported they were assured of forbearance via phone or letters but did not receive any written confirmation or notices sent to their email or mail.\\n\\n2. **Trouble Logging In and Lack of Documentation:**  \\n   Many users can't log into their servicer accounts properly and haven’t received statements or notifications, making it difficult to confirm their loan status. This could be due to technical issues, account discrepancies, or delays in system updates.\\n\\n3. **System and Process Delays:**  \\n   Several complaints highlight that loan servicers like MOHELA, Nelnet, or Aidvantage have been delays in processing applications for in-school deferments, IDR plan updates, or forbearance extensions, especially amidst ongoing court cases and regulatory changes. As a result, account statuses may not be updated promptly or accurately reflected online.\\n\\n4. **Inconsistent or Missing Official Documentation:**  \\n   Many complainants state they received verbal assurances or letters that their loans were in forbearance through a certain date, but they lack formal, in-writing confirmation or access to online records confirming these agreements. This leaves borrowers unsure whether their forbearance is valid and properly recorded.\\n\\n5. **Access and Login Problems:**  \\n   Several users mention being unable to log into their accounts or see up-to-date information, which prevents them from verifying their current status. Long wait times on customer service lines and system errors exacerbate this problem.\\n\\n**In summary:**  \\nYou’ve been told verbally or through letters that your loan was in forbearance until 2040, but without written confirmation or online verification, you're left unsure and unable to confirm this status. Your difficulty logging in, combined with reported delays and system issues from the servicers, makes it hard to get official documentation or assistance. This is a common experience reflected in the complaints, highlighting systemic issues with communication, record accuracy, and accessibility.\\n\\n**If you want to resolve this:**  \\n- Consider requesting formal, written confirmation of your forbearance status from your loan servicer in writing via certified mail.  \\n- Keep detailed records of all your communications, including dates, names, and summaries of conversations.  \\n- You may also contact the CFPB or the federal student aid ombudsman for help if your servicer continues to be unhelpful.\\n\\nPlease note, since I do not have access to your specific account, I cannot verify your exact status.

He also insisted that they, EdFinicial, would still be my loan servicers. This was deeply concerning, especially since XXXX is the designated servicer for PSLF, and my loans have not yet been transferred from EdFinancial. \\n\\nViolations and Legal Basis : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), data furnishers like EdFinancial must report accurate and timely information. Reporting me delinquent while in active repayment plan review appears to violate this principle. They are waiting over a week, despite being current as of today. \\n\\nUnder the Higher Education Act ( HEA ), borrowers in the process of applying for an income-driven plan should not be penalized with negative credit marks or be given misleading servicing advice that jeopardizes PSLF eligibility.\", 'I am filing a complaint against EdFinancial Services regarding the inaccurate reporting of a XXXX delinquency on my student loan account ending in XXXX.

These reports often appear without proper notices or warnings, suggesting potential violations of the FCRA's requirement for timely and accurate reporting of credit information.\\n\\n2. **Failure to Respond to Disputes:** Multiple consumers report that EdFinancial fails to acknowledge or investigate formal disputes regarding inaccurate reporting—violating the FCRA's obligation for furnishers to conduct reasonable investigations and correct erroneous information.\\n\\n3. **Unauthorized Disclosure of Personal Information:** Several complaints allege that EdFinancial reported or shared personal and educational information without proper consent, which raises concerns under the FCRA and FERPA. This unauthorized disclosure could constitute a violation of the FCRA's requirement that credit information be reported with accuracy and proper authorization.\\n\\n4. **Misleading or Inconsistent Communication:** Instances where EdFinancial pushes for actions like loan consolidation that could jeopardize PSLF payments, or provides conflicting information about account statuses, suggest mishandling and misrepresentation, which undermine trust and may violate fair credit reporting and consumer protection laws.\\n\\nSpecifically, your experience with the teacher loan forgiveness paperwork supports this concern because it demonstrates that EdFinancial has repeatedly handled documentation improperly—such as rejecting valid documents, giving inconsistent or run-around explanations, or delaying processing. These issues can lead to inaccurate credit reporting (such as reporting delinquencies when the loans are in good standing or awaiting approval), further indicating violations of the FCRA's requirement for accurate, timely, and transparent reporting.\\n\\nIn summary, your concerns are reinforced by multiple reported instances of delayed, inaccurate, or improper reporting and mishandling of information, which are consistent with potential violations of the FCRA by EdFinancial Services.\", multi_responses=None, reference='I think EdFinancial Services is violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) because they are supposed to do a thorough reinvestigation of disputed items on my credit report, but recent findings by the CFPB say companies like EdFinancial have done sham investigations and not met their legal obligations.

Malfunctions such as incorrect or delayed reporting—often due to payment processing errors, account mismanagement, or miscommunication—can unjustly damage a borrower's credit score and creditworthiness. For example, complaints indicate that NelNet has reported late payments or delinquencies without proper notice or verification, leading to harmful credit score drops and potential delays in major financial actions like home purchases.\\n\\nSecondly, as the auto-debit payment manager, NelNet's handling of automatic payments directly influences a borrower's financial stability. Issues like unauthorized changes to payment amounts, placement of accounts into forbearance without consent, or failure to process scheduled payments due to technical glitches have been reported. These failures can cause accounts to become delinquent or go into default, accruing additional interest, penalties, and legal consequences. \\n\\nThe combination of these roles creates a situation where errors in payment processing and reporting can lead to compounded harm. For instance, technical issues or mismanagement have reportedly resulted in accounts being flagged as delinquent without proper notifications, violating borrower rights and privacy. Alleged privacy violations, such as unauthorized account access and data breaches, further elevate the risks by exposing sensitive personal information, leading to potential identity theft and breach of federal privacy laws like FERPA and the Privacy Act.\\n\\nIn essence, NelNet's simultaneous engagement in reporting and payment management makes borrowers vulnerable to errors, misreporting, privacy violations, and consequent financial damage—especially when issues are recurrent and unresolved, as evidenced by numerous complaints and allegations.\", multi_responses=None, reference=\"NelNet, as the loan servicer, is responsible for furnishing student loan account information to credit bureaus and managing borrowers' payment processes, including auto-debit enrollments.

This exposes NelNet to liability for continuing to report or furnish data that is now under legal dispute, potentially causing reputational and financial harm to borrowers whose contracts are considered void due to these breaches. Second, in the borrower’s account (<2-hop>), NelNet is described as repeatedly failing to process auto-debit payments despite providing confirmation, deleting payment records from their website, and potentially denying borrowers the small discount associated with auto-payment. This not only creates financial inconvenience but may also result in inaccurate reporting of payment status to credit bureaus, further harming borrowers’ credit standing. Together, these issues illustrate how NelNet’s actions in both data reporting and payment management can compound legal and financial harm for borrowers, especially when privacy violations and unreliable payment processing are involved.\", rubrics=None), synthesizer_name='multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer'), TestsetSample(eval_sample=SingleTurnSample(user_input='Given that the Department of Education loans were managed through AidVantage with autopay set up and confirmed, but a past due status still appeared without notification, and considering the subsequent breach of contract claims involving the Department of Education and other agencies, how do these issues collectively support the argument for removal of the tradeline from the credit report?', retrieved_contexts=[\"I am requesting that the late payment be removed from my credit report as reported by aidVantage.

ISSUE : Lack of Verification of a Signed Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) Relevant Law : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), a credit reporting agency must conduct a reasonable reinvestigation if a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any item in their file. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), the CRA must ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information it includes. \\nDemand : I am demanding immediate deletion of the referenced student loan account ( s ) from my XXXX  credit file unless the data furnisher can provide the original, wet-ink signed Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) establishing a valid, enforceable obligation in my name. Electronic reproduction or summary data is not sufficient under federal evidentiary standards, particularly when the debt is disputed. The burden of proof lies with the furnisher. If the original contract does not exist, the tradeline must be removed. \\n\\n2. ISSUE : Failure to Verify Current Status Forbearance or Administrative Hold Relevant Law : Per 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ), the information furnisher is obligated to investigate disputed information and correct or delete any data found to be inaccurate or unverifiable. If a loan is in administrative forbearance, deferment, or a non-repayment status due to federal policy or executive order, such status must be clearly and accurately reflected in the reporting. Failure to do so constitutes willful misreporting and inaccurate furnishing of information. \\nDemand : Please verify whether this account is presently subject to administrative forbearance or any federal hold. If it is, it can not legally be reported as delinquent or in default. If this can not be fully verified and proven by the data furnisher, the account must be removed immediately for failure to meet accuracy and verification standards outlined by the FCRA. \\n\\n3. ISSUE : XXXX XXXX and XXXX  Compliance Failure Relevant Law : The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX  ) XXXX XXXX Format Guidelines, which XXXX has adopted for credit furnishing, require that all tradelines be accurate, complete, and up-to-date. Reporting disputed, unverifiable, or administratively frozen debts violates these guidelines. \\nDemand : You are required to remove any entry that does not conform with XXXX XXXX  and XXXX  standards. Student loans that are not contractually verified or are impacted by legislative changes ( such as federal repayment pauses or executive actions ) must not be reported as adverse. If you can not validate this account according to those standards, it must be removed. \\n\\nFailure to Comply Will Result in Further Action This is a legal dispute under the FCRA. Should you fail to respond within 30 days with sufficient documentation, I will escalate the matter with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and consider further legal action under 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o for willful or negligent noncompliance. \\n\\nSummary of Accounts to be Investigated and Deleted : Aidvantage / Account Number Ending in XXXX Aidvantage / Account Number Ending in XXXX  Enclosures : Copy of Photo ID Proof of Address ( Utility Bill or Bank Statement ) Copy of Credit Report Highlighting the Student Loan Accounts Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX .', 'This is my formal complaint against Aidvantage and the U.S. Department of Education regarding their failure to validate an alleged federal student loan debt.\\n\\nDespite multiple disputes and certified mailings, Aidvantage has failed to provide legally sufficient documentation. They submitted a generic master promissory note ( XXXX  ) with my name typed in, but no signature, no IP address, no e-signature audit trail, and no proof of borrower authentication or consent. This does not meet legal standards under the ESIGN Act, FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i, 1681e ( b ) ), or the Privacy Act ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ). \\n\\nThe payment records they provided are corrupted many fields show # # # # # # # # or Unavailable. There is no complete loan accounting, no deferment documentation, and no evidence that I authorized interest capitalization or balance increases. \\n\\nAdditionally, Aidvantage has submitted a transaction summary log that claims I signed the XXXX, but again, no actual signature, clickwrap agreement, IP address, or timestamp confirmation was included. They have not verified the debt, transfer of servicing rights, or my consent under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ).\\n\\nI am attaching a rebuttal letter, the transaction log they provided, and a formal Notice of Intent to Sue.

The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \\n\\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \\n\\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \\n\\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit.

This could indicate that the reporting agency failed to properly communicate or record updated, accurate account information, resulting in wrongful negative reporting.\\n\\n2. **Incorrect and Unverified Credit Reporting:** Numerous complaints involve inaccurate late payments, misreported status during periods of forbearance or administrative hold, and unverifiable account information. Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) are evident, strengthening the case that these tradelines do not meet legal standards for accuracy.\\n\\n3. **Failure of Servicing Agencies to Comply with Legal Standards:** Many consumers report that AidVantage and associated agencies did not verify the accuracy of the reported data, failed to provide proper documentation, or neglected to update the account status, especially during periods of legislative or administrative protections (such as forbearance or deferments) mandated by law.\\n\\n4. **Breach of Contract and Legal Violations:** The mentions of breaches of contract, refusal to correct errors, and ongoing legal disputes—particularly in cases of alleged falsification, unverifiable account data, or failure to provide documentation—undermine the legitimacy of the tradeline.\\n\\n5. **Impact on Consumer’s Financial and Legal Rights:** The wrongful reporting has caused tangible harm, such as credit score reductions, potential loss of home loans, and damage to creditworthiness, which were directly due to the servicing agencies' failures, not the consumer’s actions.\\n\\n**In summary**, these collective issues demonstrate that the tradeline is based on inaccurate, unverifiable, or improperly maintained information—further exacerbated by breaches of statutory and contractual obligations.

We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans.

It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This was supposedly \" resolved \\'\\' by the company in my last CFPB complaint - but I recently received a notification stating my account is being removed from forbearance ( 0 % interest and no payments until more information is available ) effective XX/XX/XXXX - even though forbearance has largely been extended to all SAVE applicants and enrollees due to the current changes made by the administration.', 'I applied for and was officially approved under the Biden Administrations SAVE Plan a federal Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) program through Aidvantage, my servicer, as directed by the U.S. Department of Education . \\n\\nDespite following all application instructions and being granted approval, I am now unable to locate any record of that SAVE Plan approval or correspondence in my servicers system or communication history.

I was thrown into forbearance status XX/XX/XXXX, with no clear explanation, or options given. I read in XX/XX/XXXX that I should be allowed to go back on IBR Plan. I tried to switch back to IBR, and not be in forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX. I called EDFinancial and asked about going back to IBR XX/XX/XXXX. I was told I could, and the woman I spoke with asked my income and household size, said Id get an email. I didnt receive any correspondence from EDFinancial. I got on students.gov account and filled out an IDR app XX/XX/XXXX, requesting to go back onto IBR. That application status is still in review to date. The IDR forgiveness tracker graph on the students.gov account said I had a little over 2 years left of repayment, until I reached enough payments for IDR forgiveness. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and was told all IDR apps were put on hold because of an injunction with SAVE Plan. I asked why IBR was being impacted, since its not SAVE. There are 5 IDR plans, not just SAVE. I received no resolve with my application. Around this time, the IDR application form was removed from the Dept of ED website, which was really concerning. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and inquired about my IBR app again. I also requested a copy of my MPN. I called EDFinancial again XX/XX/XXXX as id not received the copy of my MPN, and to ask about my IBR app. I was told theyd mailed the MPN, it was sent out. I received an email notification from student aid.gov that said IDR apps would start getting processed again to contact your servicer, I believe this was around XX/XX/XXXX. I logged onto student aid.gov XX/XX/XXXX, and notice the graph for the IDR plan forgiveness payments had disappeared from my account homepage. I called students.gov, and she denied knowing anything about what IDR forgiveness info I was talking about, she told me to call my servicer for information on my loans. She told me I also had to keep filling out a new IDR app every time they paused and restarting processing the applications. I was in shock a bit. I then called EDFinancial to ask about my IDR app ( again ). A woman spoke with me. I asked if my IDR ( IBR ) app was any closer to being processed. She said theyre behind, and its taking a long time. She told me the apps have been put on hold three times beginning XX/XX/XXXX with the last time they started processing the apps again was XX/XX/XXXX. She put me on hold when I asked what happened to my IDR repayment forgiveness tracker info that was on my students.gov account. She returned, and told me that as of Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) the Dept of Ed told EDFinancial they were not allowed to discuss IDR forgiveness payments with borrowers. I said that was preposterous, and I asked for a statement of how many months if been in repayment. I was told a statement of my payments would be mailed, and could take up to 15 days. I also asked for a copy of my MPN ( for the third time ). I asked why Id not received it, after asking for it twice already. She said it was mailed to me XX/XX/XXXX. She told me shed ask for another copy of my MPN to get mailed to me, and it would also take up to 15 days. She told me I should be able to see it on my studentaid.gov account. I asked why I can not access it on my EDFinancial account. I can not access it on my students.gov account, either. It says theres no record of my MPN on my studentaid.gov account. I asked her why my IBR application was still not processed as its been almost 3 months since I submitted it. Ive been in forbearance for 9 months when I shouldve been in repayment due to no fault of my own, a court injunction with 1 of 5 available repayment options is causing this issue. I also read that the court may have had an opinion on ICR and PAYE. This still has nothing to do with IBR or PSLF. I can not get a copy of my XXXX from EDFinancial, and it says there is not record of if on my studentaid.gov account. My IDR repayment information has been disappeared from my students.gov account, and I was told by EDFinancial that they could not talk to anyone about IDR forgiveness or payments that had been made to count towards that ( by the DOE on XX/XX/XXXX ). This doesnt seem legal. Its really confusing bouncing back and forth between the Dept of ed ( students.gov ) and EDFinancial. I graduated in XX/XX/XXXX. Ive been in repayment since XX/XX/XXXX.

She understood that I did not want to make payments that were not in an XXXX plan because they would not qualify for XXXX. She said the processing forbearance wont be done automatically, but at that point I can call and ask because theyll see the new XXXX application on file.

Inaccurate Credit Reporting and Harmful Impact on Credit Scores:\\n   - NelNet has been reported to inaccurately report loan statuses, including late payments and delinquencies, even when accounts are in forbearance or paid up. Such misreporting can unjustly damage borrowers' credit scores, making it more difficult or expensive to obtain credit or loans.\\n2. Unauthorized or Inappropriate Debt Collection:\\n   - Allegations of fraudulent or reckless collection practices, such as reporting settled accounts as delinquent or refusing to recognize payments made, can lead to violations of federal laws like the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).\\n3. Privacy Violations and Data Breaches:\\n   - Reports of unauthorized access to borrower accounts, data breaches, and potential FERPA violations suggest serious privacy concerns. Such breaches expose personal and financial information, risking identity theft and further misuse.\\n4. Recurring Payment Processing Issues:\\n   - As the entity managing auto-debit payments, NelNet's repeated processing errors can result in missed or double payments, late fees, or unwarranted collection actions, harming borrowers’ financial stability.\\n5. Lack of Transparency and Poor Communication:\\n   - Borrowers have reported inadequate communication regarding account transfers, statuses, and options, leading to confusion and unintentional delinquency, which then get reported adversely.\\n\\nIn light of these issues, especially the alleged privacy violations and recurring payment processing problems, borrowers face the risk of:\\n- Incorrect negative credit entries impacting current and future financial opportunities.\\n- Unauthorized account activity and potential privacy breaches undermining trust and security.\\n- Financial harm due to misapplied payments, improper reporting, and obstacles in managing or resolving their loans.\\n\\nOverall, NelNet’s responsibilities, if mishandled as indicated, can result in serious legal violations, financial damages, and erosion of borrower trust, underscoring the importance of proper oversight and compliance.\", multi_responses=None, reference=\"NelNet, as the loan servicer, is responsible for furnishing student loan account information to credit bureaus and managing borrowers' payment processes, including auto-debit enrollments.

Continued reporting of these debts, which may be legally void or unverified, constitutes a violation of federal laws (FCRA and FDCPA).\\n\\n2. **Failure of Due Process and Notification:** Despite confirmed autopay setups and management through AidVantage, the appearance of a past due status without notification indicates a breach of contractual and consumer rights.

It documents a new, independently reportable violationspecifically, Aidvantages continued misrepresentation of a prior CFPB complaint filed against XXXX ( ID XXXX ) as the basis for its internal fraud classification, as well as its stated policy of collapsing multiple complaints into a single response record. \\n========================================================================= Any attempt by Aidvantage to mischaracterize this complaint as previously addressed or duplicative will be treated as a fraudulent procedural act and a misuse of the federal consumer complaint system, in violation of : 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) Prohibition on deceptive and abusive acts or practices ( UDAAP ) ; 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) Furnishers duty to correct and update inaccurate information ; D.C.

Consumer Protection Procedures Act ; 18 U.S.C. 1001 Material false statements to a federal agency or in a matter within federal jurisdiction. \\n========================================================================= This complaint arises from a new, post-dated violation that took place after prior complaints were filed. It involves a materially false assertion made by Aidvantage in its XX/XX/2025 response, falsely linking a separate CFPB complaint ( filed against XXXX ) to its internal servicing records, and reaffirming a pattern of improper fraud designation and procedural concealment. \\n========================================================================= Furthermore, Aidvantages stated policy of responding to multiple complaints under one CFPB complaint number constitutes an attempt to suppress individualized complaint visibility, obstruct the official regulatory record, and evade accountability for ongoing and distinct legal violations. \\n========================================================================= Any further attempt by Aidvantage to mislabel this submission as duplicative or to suppress its factual and legal claims through internal aggregation policies will be preserved as evidence of regulatory misconduct and will be escalated as warranted. \\n========================================================================= NOTICE : Aidvantages continued misuse of the CFPBs complaint designation system to obscure procedural violations is being independently tracked as part of an active evidentiary dossier for potential regulatory enforcement and civil litigation, if warranted. \\n========================================================================= Subject : Systemic Misrepresentation by Aidvantage False Identity Theft Designation, Unauthorized Use of CFPB Complaint Record, and Violation of Federal Furnisher Obligations ========================================================================= To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, FTC ========================================================================= CC : Aidvantage Credit Bureau Management ========================================================================= Date : XX/XX/2025 ========================================================================= Complainant : XXXX XXXX XXXX ========================================================================= Complaint ID Referenced ( for background ) : ========================================================================= XXXX ========================================================================= XXXX ========================================================================= XXXX ========================================================================= XXXX ========================================================================= Affirmation of Independent Legal Action and Federal Record Accuracy ========================================================================= I submit this complaint in my individual legal capacity and affirm that I am not affiliated with any credit repair organization. This submission documents federal loan servicing misconduct and preserves all rights for civil, regulatory, and evidentiary enforcement.

Unauthorized Identity Theft Designation of Federal Loan Account ========================================================================= Aidvantage unilaterally designated one or more of my federal student loan accounts as involving identity theft without my authorization, without law enforcement documentation, and without any identity theft report submitted by me. \\n========================================================================= This act constitutes : ========================================================================= A material misrepresentation of the status of a federal student loan, ========================================================================= A falsification of servicing records, ========================================================================= A violation of FCRA 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) and 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ( UDAAP ). \\n========================================================================= I have submitted a notarized affidavit and two FTC Fraud Reports affirming no identity theft was reported. Aidvantage proceeded with a fraud designation despite this documentation. \\n========================================================================= XXXX. Misuse of CFPB Complaint System to Justify Internal Fraud Protocol ========================================================================= In its XX/XX/2025 response, Aidvantage cited CFPB Complaint ID XXXX was filed against XXXX the basis for initiating a fraud classification on my federal loan. \\n========================================================================= This claim is demonstrably false. \\n========================================================================= The referenced complaint does not mention identity theft, was not submitted against Aidvantage, and was never intended as a fraud-related dispute. Aidvantages use of this record to trigger internal fraud protocols constitutes a misrepresentation in a federal proceeding and may violate : ========================================================================= 18 U.S.C. 1001 False statements to a federal agency, ========================================================================= 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 2 ) Misrepresentation to a consumer or regulator, ========================================================================= FCRA 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) Furnisher duty to correct inaccurate information. \\n========================================================================= III. Transmission or Attempted Transmission of False Identity Theft Information ========================================================================= Aidvantage has either transmitted or attempted to transmit this false identity theft classification to one or more consumer reporting agencies through E-Oscar or equivalent systems. \\n========================================================================= This conduct violates : ========================================================================= FCRA 1681e ( b ) Failure to ensure maximum possible accuracy, ========================================================================= 12 C.F.R. 1022.42 Accuracy and Integrity Rule under FACTA, ========================================================================= CFPB Bulletin 2014-01 Prohibition on furnishing misleading or false information. \\nXXXX Aidvantage has not produced documentation identifying the system or person responsible for triggering the fraud classification despite multiple formal requests. \\n========================================================================= IV. Procedural Suppression of the Official Regulatory Record ========================================================================= Aidvantages statement that multiple complaints regarding the same concerns will be responded to under one CFPB complaint number reflects a policy of collapsing distinct complaints to limit regulatory exposure. \\n========================================================================= This tactic obstructs the integrity of the Bureaus public complaint system. Each complaint filed documents new dates, new legal violations, and escalating conduct. Collapsing separate records may violate : ========================================================================= 12 U.S.C. 5495 CFPB coordination and supervisory authority requirements. \\n========================================================================= This behavior appears designed to evade systemic accountability for recurring violations. \\n========================================================================= V. Enforcement Referral and Legal Preservation ========================================================================= Pursuant to the Bureaus statutory mandate under 12 U.S.C. 5495 ( Coordination ), I formally request that this matter be referred for supervisory and enforcement review, and that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau coordinate with relevant federal and state agencies to ensure proper oversight, investigation, and legal remedy. \\n========================================================================= The following agency referrals are warranted based on distinct legal authorities, each directly implicated by Aidvantages conduct : ========================================================================= 1. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Enforcement Division ========================================================================= Aidvantages actions violate core provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, including : ========================================================================= o 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) : Duty of furnishers to correct and update inaccurate information.\\n\\n========================================================================= o 15 U.S.C. 1681i : Failure to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation upon notice of dispute.\\n\\n========================================================================= o 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) : Prohibition on deceptive or abusive acts or practices under the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( UDAAP ).\\n\\n========================================================================= These violations fall squarely within the CFPBs enforcement jurisdiction and implicate the agencys role in overseeing the accuracy and integrity of the credit reporting system.\\n\\n========================================================================= 2. Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) ========================================================================= Aidvantages repeated misrepresentations to both consumer and regulatorparticularly its misuse of an unrelated CFPB complaint to justify a false fraud designationviolate the Federal Trade Commission Act, specifically : ========================================================================= o 15 U.S.C. 45 ( a ) : Prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. \\n========================================================================= The FTC retains parallel jurisdiction over non-bank servicers and deceptive consumer-facing practices, and is positioned to investigate systemic misrepresentation or pattern violations. \\n========================================================================= 3. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) Civil Division, Consumer Protection Branch ========================================================================= Aidvantages conduct may constitute federal offenses under : ========================================================================= a. 18 U.S.C. 1001 : False statements in matters within the jurisdiction of a federal agency.\\n\\n========================================================================= b. 18 U.S.C. 1341 : Mail fraud, based on the use of USPS to transmit materially false information.\\n\\n========================================================================= c. 18 U.S.C. 1343 : Wire fraud, where electronic systems ( including CFPB portal and E-Oscar transmissions ) were used to perpetuate misrepresentations. \\n\\n========================================================================= DOJ is authorized to initiate both civil and criminal proceedings where false statements or fraudulent schemes affect federal records or regulatory systems. \\n========================================================================= 4. National Association of Attorneys General ( NAAG ) ========================================================================= Aidvantages conduct may violate multiple state-level consumer protection laws, including : ========================================================================= d. D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act ( CPPA ), D.C. Code 28-3904 ( e ), ( f ) : Prohibiting misrepresentation and omission of material facts in connection with consumer services. \\n\\n========================================================================= Given the multistate and federally regulated nature of the loan, a NAAG-coordinated review is appropriate under 5495s requirement for intergovernmental coordination to prevent regulatory evasion. \\n\\n\\n========================================================================= All factual assertions, sworn affidavits, and certified documents are preserved in accordance with the Federal Rules of Evidence 902 and 1005. No further burden-shifting, misclassification, or procedural obfuscation by Aidvantage will be accepted. This matter now requires cross-agency supervisory action. \\n========================================================================= Submitted by : XXXX XXXX XXXX', 'To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate and inconsistent reporting of my federal student loan balance across all three major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ).

When credit reporting agencies or servicers mishandle sensitive information or fail to properly investigate disputes, they not only violate privacy laws and contractual duties but also contribute to inaccurate credit reporting, which can result in wrongful debt assessments, harm to credit scores, and further rights violations.\\n\\nThus, the CFPB's recent findings underscore the importance of proper investigative procedures, accurate reporting, and data security—areas where many of the complaints allege violations.

We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans.

It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed.

It wasn't until he could no longer provide relevant information I requested that he granted my transfer to his supervisor. \\n\\nHe informed me the delinquency would be reversed and my account would be reported as current by XX/XX/year> due to my pending IDR application A supervisor, XXXX, confirmed retroactive payment adjustments and provided a timeline of prior contact attempts many of which I never received. \\n\\nI have already filed disputes with XXXX XXXX XXXX and submitted My first complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). \\n\\nThis now the issue I am having with EdFinicial : PSLF Concerns : During the call, XXXX pushed me to consolidate my loans, despite the fact that doing so would cause me to lose all XXXX qualifying PSLF payments already recorded. He also insisted that they, EdFinicial, would still be my loan servicers. This was deeply concerning, especially since XXXX is the designated servicer for PSLF, and my loans have not yet been transferred from EdFinancial. \\n\\nViolations and Legal Basis : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), data furnishers like EdFinancial must report accurate and timely information. Reporting me delinquent while in active repayment plan review appears to violate this principle.

I did not provide such consent, and I was not informed that my data would be shared with third parties in a way that could damage my credit. \\n\\nIn addition, this situation raises concerns under 20 U.S. Code 1092, which mandates that institutions and their agents must clearly disclose all terms of student loans, including repayment obligations, grace periods, and the consequences of default or late payment. If I had not been properly informed of how and when credit damage could occur - or if disclosures were ambiguous or incomplete- this would constitute a failure to meet federal disclosure requirements. \\n\\nUnder The Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S. Code 1681, specifically, the account reported by EdFinancial Services relating to my student loans is inaccurate and misleading and was reported without proper disclosure and authorization.

Because of litigation I was automatically placed in a XXXX level repayment plan which I never selected and which isnt XXXX so it wont count towards XXXX. I was initially told I am not not eligible for administrative forbearance because I was never in XXXX XXXX, but that is because of the timing of my application and the only option is for me to keep calling back to extend the forbearance. I also cant enter an XXXX plan even if I want to because there is a processing pause. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX a Mohela supervisor extended my forbearance for XXXX year through XX/XX/XXXX so I did not have to call back each month.

As a XXXX individual who has spent my entire adult life building and maintaining strong credit, this sudden decline has been not only financially damaging but also deeply disheartening. \\n\\nPrior to these recent Department of Education loan reports, my credit history was overwhelmingly positive, marked by over 99 % of on-time payments with only a few isolated XXXX  days past due occurrences, each of which were accidental and never reflective of an unwillingness to meet my obligations. I have consistently chosen to carry loans and pay extended interest to build and preserve my credit. This recent event has left me feeling utterly defeated, with the prospect of spending the next XXXX years working to rebuild my score seeming nearly insurmountable. \\n\\nIn the past week, Ive read hundreds, if not thousands of testimonies from others who are enduring the exact same hardship. It is clear that this issue is not the result of individual negligence, but rather the consequence of a systemic breakdown impacting people nationwide. \\n\\nBefore this change, I had approximately {$96000.00} in available credit card lines, of which only about 2 % was utilized. Now, with my credit scores severely affected, my available credit has been slashed to nearly nothing. As a result, I am currently unable to secure financing for a vehicle, a home, or any other need that depends on a functional credit score. \\n\\nThe student loans in question were placed in forbearance while I pursued XXXX XXXX ( becoming a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and during the federal Covid-related pause. During this time, the loans were transferred to Nelnet and fragmented into XXXX separate accounts. Despite my efforts, including submitting paperwork on multiple occasions during the forbearance period and calling and talking to representatives, I was unable to complete the consolidation process or establish a manageable repayment plan. Importantly, these loans remained in forbearance throughout this time. \\n\\nFollowing the credit report changes on XX/XX/XXXX, I was finally able to speak with a representative at Nelnet, who graciously assisted in placing the loans back into forbearance ( after which they had been removed to forbearance without me understanding what was going on ) to allow time for consolidation and payment setup. I want to emphasize that I have never had the intention to avoid repaying any debt I owe or any debt I've ever owed. My long-standing credit record serves as a testament to that commitment. \\n\\nTo characterize this situation as frustrating would be a gross understatement. The complexity and opacity of the current loan servicing and credit reporting system are overwhelming even to the most diligent and responsible individuals. There is a clear and urgent need for reform. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to have received student loans, as they allowed me to pursue an education that would not have been possible otherwise. I did not have familial financial support, and without a degree, I would never have had access to a job that could support repayment or my family entirely. \\n\\nHowever, many of us who have tried to do everything right now find ourselves in crisis.

Based on the complaints and information available, the delays in Nelnet updating your payment status after forbearance often stem from administrative processing times, communication issues, or system delays within their loan servicing operations. Sometimes, changes like approving a forbearance or updating payment plans require manual processing or coordination between different departments, which can extend the time before the changes are reflected in your account. Additionally, there may be instances where miscommunication or lack of timely notification can cause delays in updating your account status.\\n\\nIn some complaints, borrowers noted that even after being told their accounts were placed into forbearance, the updates did not appear promptly, and subsequent notifications or credit reporting did not align with what was communicated. This can happen if the servicing system has internal delays or if documentation and communication between the servicer and the borrower are not immediate.\\n\\nIf you are experiencing long delays, it might help to contact Nelnet directly, request a confirmation in writing, and keep records of your communications. Also, reaching out to the Department of Education or filing a complaint with the CFPB could help address systemic issues.\\n\\nPlease note, I do not have access to your specific account details, so there could be other particular reasons in your case.

You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans.

It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed.

I was thrown into forbearance status XX/XX/XXXX, with no clear explanation, or options given. I read in XX/XX/XXXX that I should be allowed to go back on IBR Plan. I tried to switch back to IBR, and not be in forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX. I called EDFinancial and asked about going back to IBR XX/XX/XXXX. I was told I could, and the woman I spoke with asked my income and household size, said Id get an email. I didnt receive any correspondence from EDFinancial. I got on students.gov account and filled out an IDR app XX/XX/XXXX, requesting to go back onto IBR. That application status is still in review to date. The IDR forgiveness tracker graph on the students.gov account said I had a little over 2 years left of repayment, until I reached enough payments for IDR forgiveness. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and was told all IDR apps were put on hold because of an injunction with SAVE Plan. I asked why IBR was being impacted, since its not SAVE. There are 5 IDR plans, not just SAVE. I received no resolve with my application. Around this time, the IDR application form was removed from the Dept of ED website, which was really concerning. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and inquired about my IBR app again. I also requested a copy of my MPN. I called EDFinancial again XX/XX/XXXX as id not received the copy of my MPN, and to ask about my IBR app. I was told theyd mailed the MPN, it was sent out. I received an email notification from student aid.gov that said IDR apps would start getting processed again to contact your servicer, I believe this was around XX/XX/XXXX. I logged onto student aid.gov XX/XX/XXXX, and notice the graph for the IDR plan forgiveness payments had disappeared from my account homepage. I called students.gov, and she denied knowing anything about what IDR forgiveness info I was talking about, she told me to call my servicer for information on my loans. She told me I also had to keep filling out a new IDR app every time they paused and restarting processing the applications. I was in shock a bit. I then called EDFinancial to ask about my IDR app ( again ). A woman spoke with me. I asked if my IDR ( IBR ) app was any closer to being processed. She said theyre behind, and its taking a long time. She told me the apps have been put on hold three times beginning XX/XX/XXXX with the last time they started processing the apps again was XX/XX/XXXX. She put me on hold when I asked what happened to my IDR repayment forgiveness tracker info that was on my students.gov account. She returned, and told me that as of Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) the Dept of Ed told EDFinancial they were not allowed to discuss IDR forgiveness payments with borrowers. I said that was preposterous, and I asked for a statement of how many months if been in repayment. I was told a statement of my payments would be mailed, and could take up to 15 days. I also asked for a copy of my MPN ( for the third time ). I asked why Id not received it, after asking for it twice already. She said it was mailed to me XX/XX/XXXX. She told me shed ask for another copy of my MPN to get mailed to me, and it would also take up to 15 days. She told me I should be able to see it on my studentaid.gov account. I asked why I can not access it on my EDFinancial account. I can not access it on my students.gov account, either. It says theres no record of my MPN on my studentaid.gov account. I asked her why my IBR application was still not processed as its been almost 3 months since I submitted it. Ive been in forbearance for 9 months when I shouldve been in repayment due to no fault of my own, a court injunction with 1 of 5 available repayment options is causing this issue. I also read that the court may have had an opinion on ICR and PAYE. This still has nothing to do with IBR or PSLF. I can not get a copy of my XXXX from EDFinancial, and it says there is not record of if on my studentaid.gov account. My IDR repayment information has been disappeared from my students.gov account, and I was told by EDFinancial that they could not talk to anyone about IDR forgiveness or payments that had been made to count towards that ( by the DOE on XX/XX/XXXX ).

Who Can Access the Information : The privacy act outlines that access to your information is authorized for : Federal, state, or local agencies ( but these agencies must have a legitimate purpose as defined under law or regulation ). \\n\\nSpecific private parties ( like financial institutions, guaranty agencies, and educational institutions ) under controlled circumstances ( e.g., loan servicing, fraud investigation ). \\n\\nConsumer reporting agencies for credit-related purposes or loan delinquency tracking. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX DOGE ( Department of Government Efficiency ) does not fall into any of these categories. Specifically, there is no legal or formal authorization for DOGE or its personnel to access or handle educational loan records from the Department of Education. DOGE is not listed as an authorized agency or party under the Master Promissory Note 's routine uses. This means that any action by DOGE, including accessing or disclosing loan-related information, would violate the terms set forth in this agreement and would be an unauthorized disclosure. \\n\\n2. No Explicit Authorization for DOGE or XXXXXXXX XXXX : The privacy statement does not list DOGE or any organization associated with XXXX XXXX as a permissible third party. The language about disclosures specifies agencies and institutions involved in loan servicing, fraud prevention, and collection efforts, but DOGE is not among them. Additionally, DOGE is not a government agency that could be granted access to federal records like the Department of Educations student loan data. \\n\\n3. Legitimate Purposes : The passage details the legitimate purposes for data access and disclosure, such as fraud investigation, verifying eligibility, loan servicing, and collections. DOGE does not have a recognized legal or institutional role within these processes. Unless DOGE had been explicitly granted a role by an appropriate federal authority ( which has not been documented or authorized ), they would have no legal standing to access educational records, including loan records under the Master Promissory Note. \\n\\n4. Violation of FERPA and Privacy Act : The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) also protects educational records from unauthorized access, and based on the information in your complaint, its clear that DOGEs actions likely violated FERPA as well. FERPA limits access to student records without the student 's written consent, except in specific circumstances ( such as disclosures to specific educational officials or authorized third parties ). XXXX XXXX, acting through DOGE, did not have the necessary authorization under FERPA to access these records. \\n\\n5.

Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\\n\\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \\n\\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures.

Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\\n\\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\\n\\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\\n\\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\\n\\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\\n\\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\\n\\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action.

This request is based on the violation of my rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), which protects the privacy of student education records, including personal and financial information.\\n\\nMy data was compromised and improperly disclosed, constituting a serious breach of FERPA. This violation not only undermines the legitimacy of the loan servicing process in my case but also contributes to the broader pattern of misconduct already established against XXXX. \\n\\nI am aware of the lawsuit filed against XXXX  by various state attorneys general and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which accused the company of deceptive practices, including steering borrowers into costly forbearance, misrepresenting payment options, and failing to provide clear and accurate information. These findings further support my position that the management of my loans has been unlawful and unethical. \\n\\nRecently, I noticed a significant decrease in my credit scoreover XXXX pointsand upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered that my student loan account was reported in a misleading and inaccurate manner. \\n\\nI have been enrolled in an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan for several years, which should not negatively impact my credit score. However, the account has been reported as if it was in default, which is false and does not reflect my current repayment status. As per the guidelines of the IDR plan, the loan should not be reported as negative on my credit report, but it has been, causing significant harm to my credit standing. \\n\\nIt appears that this misreporting is due to XXXX inaccurate reporting practices, and I believe this issue is tied to the ongoing legal matters involving XXXX, which were recently publicized.', 'Subject : Follow-Up to CFPB Complaint # XXXX Discrepancies, Fraud Concerns, and Inadequate Validation of Federal Loan To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to submit an updated and urgent follow-up to my complaint under case number XXXX regarding an alleged student loan serviced by Aidvantage. \\n\\nWhile the loan is claimed to fall under the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I have received a Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) as validation, I must emphasize that this documentation does not adequately validate the debt as legally mine for the following reasons : 1.

Potential Fraud and Misrepresentation The MPN itself states under False Certification and Unauthorized Payments that borrowers may be discharged from loan obligations in cases of : Identity theft, Falsified signatures, Fraudulent certification by the school, and Situations where the borrower did not attend the school or did not benefit from the program. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX the institution linked to this loan has a documented history of irregularities and possible fraud.

During the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I happened to log into my servicer 's ( Aidvantage ) website, to confirm the date. The dates it shows that my forbearance ends is XX/XX/XXXX, and not XX/XX/XXXX. I called the servicer and was told that my forbearance ended XX/XX/XXXX. I told the representative that I have 3 different dates that the forbearance would end, and I don't know which date was accurate. The representative proceeded to tell me that the XX/XX/XXXX date was accurate. I explained that I had not received any communication telling me that. I asked her if a letter had been sent to me. She said notifications were set up to go to my phone. I asked her why that wasbthe case ask I had been getting notifications via XXXX postal mail and I hadn't requested that it be changed. I asked that she provide the dates notifications were sent to my phone and to provide me with a copy that was said to have been sent to my phone. She said she didn't see that anything had been sent to me. I explained that had I not called or logged into my online account, I would have never known when the Administrative forbearance would end. As it stands I still don't know when my forbearance will end under the SAVE repayment plan. I'm concerned about my credit being negatively affected for the loan servicer 's failure to provide me with accurate notifications of what is to be expected ; therefore, I am asking you for help in getting this matter resolved.\", 'I was in an XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) plan for almost XXXX years. I consolidated my loans in XX/XX/XXXX to take advantage of the one-time account adjustment and when I consolidated I selected the lowest payment plan which was XXXX. Because of litigation I was automatically placed in a XXXX level repayment plan which I never selected and which isnt XXXX so it wont count towards XXXX. I was initially told I am not not eligible for administrative forbearance because I was never in XXXX XXXX, but that is because of the timing of my application and the only option is for me to keep calling back to extend the forbearance. I also cant enter an XXXX plan even if I want to because there is a processing pause. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX a Mohela supervisor extended my forbearance for XXXX year through XX/XX/XXXX so I did not have to call back each month. This helped me avoid making payments on a plan that would not count towards XXXX. I have a recording of this conversation. She also helped me submit a paper application for a new XXXX plan, but said she could not guarantee when this would be processed due to the pause, but in the meanwhile I would be in forbearance so I wouldn\\'t have to worry. I uploaded the paper version of the XXXX application that day. \\nBecause of my XXXX application, I received a letter from Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX stating that \" We recently received your income-driven repayment ( XXXX ) application, but since a federal court issued an injunction preventing the XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) from operating the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Plan and other XXXX plans, XXXX application processing is taking longer than normal. \\nDue to these delays your XXXX application is in a pending status and MOHELA is putting your account into a forbearance for up to XXXX  days. \\'\\' My XXXX  application got denied due to a missing signature ( even though a Mohela supervisor looked over my application and told me it was complete ), so after calling and speaking with another supervisor to determine why my XXXX was denied, I submitted a new XXXX application on XX/XX/XXXX with the signature needed. That supervisor explained that if my application is not approved before my next payment date of XX/XX/XXXX, I can call to be placed on processing forbearance. She understood that I did not want to make payments that were not in an XXXX plan because they would not qualify for XXXX. She said the processing forbearance wont be done automatically, but at that point I can call and ask because theyll see the new XXXX application on file. Unfortunately I have been trying to call to ask and can not get through to anyone because of the outrageously long hold times. However, I did receive a letter from Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX ( I will upload ) that said \" A federal court issued an injunction preventing the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) from operating the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Plan and some other XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) plans. As a result of this ruling, XXXX has directed MOHELA to put your account into a forbearance because either : XXXX. You are currently a borrower on XXXX. \\nXXXX. XXXX  Days have passed since we received your XXXX application, and it has not yet been processed. \\'\\' So again, like last time, I was told my account was in forbearance. Today, on XX/XX/XXXX, my account is saying PAST DUE from XXXX and I have another payment coming up on XX/XX/XXXX. I am worried this will wrongfully affect my credit. Clearly the forbearance was not properly put on my account. I have been trying every day to call for XXXX month, but each time I call the wait time is XXXX hours and I can never get through to a representative. In the past even if I was able to get a hold of an account representative, the first agent I spoke with insisted I had to be transferred. When I get transferred I am just put on hold for hours on end and a supervisor never calls me back, so my account is still wrongfully showed past due. I have called about this issue every day for the past month. The shortest wait time is XXXX hours even during the recommended time to call which is Thursday and Friday from XXXX. I will continue to try to call to resolve this issue, but in the meanwhile I felt this complaint was necessary as Im worried I will soon be reported to collections. Mohela is operating a deflection scheme to avoid resolving the issue and updating my account status.', 'I got a subsidized loan. After having issues with the university I was attending I took a semester off to transfer to a new school. In that time they put me on forbearance twice without reaching out to me for it and sent vague emails about needing to look at my account. In the fall of XXXX  I tried logging in to prove I was a student after getting an email regarding past due payments. They couldnt locate my account on the website I tried a few more times but said my information couldnt be located even though I was receiving emails. I tried calling the number provided but I dont remember the conversation just that it didnt help I was finally able to access my account less than 30 days ago and made a payment on the past due amount. I reached out as they ended up putting XXXX reports of missed payments on my credit history. They confirmed the issue but said I had not called. If they have access to my email and phone number information then I shouldve never had to have spent months trying to get access to my account. I can pull my call history and prove I tried calling as well. When I reached out to see if they could correct the report on my history they said they would not unless I could prove I was a student at the time of the report or was military but the error occurred regardless of either of those statuses. I can also provide my transcript for the fall but I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and will not have classes till the summer and do not think they reported me in the XXXX semester I am not taking classes as a coincidence after putting me on unauthorized forbearance while I was taking classes.', 'I applied for an XXXX in XXXX. It was denied without notice, and without telling me why. I found out about this on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately applied again. However, since I was never told why my first application was denied, I didn\\'t know if I needed to fix or change anything on my second application. After my first application, my loans were automatically put into processing forbearance. After my second application, they were not. I messaged to ask them to please put them into processing forbearance several times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), and only received generic and irrelevant messages in response. I\\'m also serving an XXXX term and am eligible for my loans to be in forbearance due to that. I was unable to request this on Mohela \\'s website because there is no option for it, despite a button that says \" I\\'m in the military or public service - volunteer for a nonprofit, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. \\'\\' When you click that button, it takes you to a page where the only option is military service. I was able to apply through XXXX, and it took them XXXX days to approve the request, but when they did they only approved it for XXXX of my loans. I want them ALL in forbearance. In the meantime, due to the processing pause on XXXX applications, their website had a notification that said, \" If you have an IDR application that has not been processed within XXXX days and have an unpaid bill within XXXX days of the due date, MOHELA will automatically place a processing forbearance as directed by Federal Student Aid to your account. No action is required by you. \\'\\' This applies to me. So I was waiting for my loans to be put into forbearance but they never were. My bill was well over ten days past due, and still nothing. I paid the bill out of fear for my credit score, but this is completely unacceptable. If no action is required by me, why am I having to message them twice about it ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) only for nothing to happen? I have sent them five messages total ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) about this whole fiasco, and have never had a helpful response, if I received one at all. The three responses I have gotten ( the dates of which I\\'m unsure of because they don\\'t contain a timestamp, which at this point feels purposeful and malicious ) have been an obviously copy and pasted default answer in response to the words \" XXXX \\'\\' or \" forbearance \\'\\' and do not at all relate to my specific questions and situation. I\\'ve also tried calling, but have never been able to connect with a real person, just an unhelpful robot. I work full time and I don\\'t have time to sit on hold for hours on end. I submitted a complaint to XXXX, who said they would respond within XXXX  days, but today is day XXXX and I have reached my limit of what I\\'m willing to deal with. This is the absolute worst company I have every had the displeasure of working with. Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not follow through with the claims they make on their website. The stakes here are very high, and they continue to drop the ball and they can not be trusted. I can no longer find the notification on their website about the XXXX application that hasn\\'t been processed in XXXX days. It\\'s been replaced with one that says \" Borrows that have a pending IDR application may also be placed on a forbearance until no later than XX/XX/XXXX. \\'\\' So which one is it? They can not claim to be automatically putting loans into forbearance in one notification, and then say that it\\'s only a possibility in another one. I\\'m glad I took a screen shot of the first notification, otherwise I wouldn\\'t have any proof of this. I understand that this is a stressful and uncertain time for federal loans, but it is completely unacceptable to leave me in this situation.', 'My account was in forbearance until XXXX  until recently. They took my account and reported it as 90 days past due to the credit bureau, which negatively affected my credit score. Now there are no options to apply for a SAVE or Income Driven Repayment.

We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans. As advised on XX/XX/XXXX, we are unable to process the plan due to the court injunction.

It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This was supposedly \" resolved \\'\\' by the company in my last CFPB complaint - but I recently received a notification stating my account is being removed from forbearance ( 0 % interest and no payments until more information is available ) effective XX/XX/XXXX - even though forbearance has largely been extended to all SAVE applicants and enrollees due to the current changes made by the administration.', \"I requested to be placed on the XXXX plan and was placed on forbearance.

The reports also suggest the servicers often rely on verbal assurances during calls without sending written confirmation, which leaves borrowers in a difficult position.\\n\\nTo address your situation, consider:\\n\\n1. Requestting written confirmation of your forbearance period and account status from your servicer in writing—preferably via certified mail or email.\\n2. Document all interactions, including dates, names, and summaries of phone calls.\\n3. If login access is an issue, try resetting passwords or contacting the servicer through official channels and requesting account access issues be resolved.\\n4. Filing a formal complaint with the CFPB and your state attorney general if you continue to encounter unhelpful responses or lack of transparency.\\n5. Seeking assistance from a student loan ombudsman or an attorney specializing in student debt to help advocate on your behalf.\\n\\nSince the complaints frequently mention difficulties logging in, getting help, or receiving documentation, persistent follow-up and formal written requests may help establish a record of your efforts.

Assuming there was fraudulent activity, I immediately filed a report with XXXX to investigate. The report revealed that Nelnet had posted 16 delinquent payments to my accountall on the same day. \\n\\nConfused, I contacted Nelnet and learned that they had taken over my student loans from Great Lakes. Under Great Lakes, I was enrolled in an income-driven deferment program due to unemployment, meaning I was not required to make payments. However, when Nelnet assumed control of my loans, they removed my deferment status without notifying me. Complicating matters further, I had originally three loans with Great Lakes, but Nelnet reorganized them into 16 separate accounts, drastically increasing the impact of their reporting. \\n\\nSince I had moved out of state, I never received any mail from Nelnet, leaving me completely unaware of the situation. I was also unable to set up an online account with them initially, as my address did not match what they had on file. After persistent efforts, I finally gained access to my Nelnet account and started receiving correspondence. \\n\\nAdding to my frustration, I discovered that Nelnet is currently facing multiple class-action lawsuits for similar issues. When I asked them for details about my loan transition, they could not provide any information about my original Great Lakes balances or interest rates. Since Great Lakes is no longer in service, I have no way of verifying my previous records. \\n\\nI have formally disputed the delinquent payments with XXXX, as I was never informed of them, yet Nelnet refuses to remove them.

DOGE is not listed as an authorized agency or party under the Master Promissory Note 's routine uses. This means that any action by DOGE, including accessing or disclosing loan-related information, would violate the terms set forth in this agreement and would be an unauthorized disclosure. \\n\\n2. No Explicit Authorization for DOGE or XXXXXXXX XXXX : The privacy statement does not list DOGE or any organization associated with XXXX XXXX as a permissible third party. The language about disclosures specifies agencies and institutions involved in loan servicing, fraud prevention, and collection efforts, but DOGE is not among them. Additionally, DOGE is not a government agency that could be granted access to federal records like the Department of Educations student loan data. \\n\\n3. Legitimate Purposes : The passage details the legitimate purposes for data access and disclosure, such as fraud investigation, verifying eligibility, loan servicing, and collections. DOGE does not have a recognized legal or institutional role within these processes. Unless DOGE had been explicitly granted a role by an appropriate federal authority ( which has not been documented or authorized ), they would have no legal standing to access educational records, including loan records under the Master Promissory Note. \\n\\n4. Violation of FERPA and Privacy Act : The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) also protects educational records from unauthorized access, and based on the information in your complaint, its clear that DOGEs actions likely violated FERPA as well. FERPA limits access to student records without the student 's written consent, except in specific circumstances ( such as disclosures to specific educational officials or authorized third parties ). XXXX XXXX, acting through DOGE, did not have the necessary authorization under FERPA to access these records. \\n\\n5. Absence of Transparency on Data Usage : Since there is no clear or documented disclosure allowing DOGE to access or utilize the educational records, it would be safe to say that DOGEs actions likely constitute a violation of not just the Master Promissory Note 's terms but also of privacy and security regulations set out by the Department of Education and relevant federal laws. \\n\\nConclusion : The privacy act of 1974 you from our Master Promissory Note outlines the specific and authorized uses of personal information related to student loans, none of which includes access by DOGE. Therefore, XXXX XXXX XXXX had no legitimate or legal authority to access the Department of Educations records, and their actions represent a clear violation of the terms of the Master Promissory Note, as well as possibly violating federal laws like FERPA and the Privacy Act. \\n\\nReference Information below How XXXX XXXX DOGE Took Over the Education Department, One Office at a Time Published : Wed, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX EST Updated : Wed, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX EST XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Inside DOGE 's Takeover of the Education Department Staffers at the Department of Education worry the Department of Government Efficiency is accessing sensitive information and spreading confusion. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX Says Department of Education No Longer Exists XXXX XXXX XXXX\", \"When my federal student loans were transferred to Nelnet, Servicer to Federal Student Aid, in XX/XX/XXXX, I enrolled in AutoPay with a scheduled monthly payment of {$190.00}.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 As a borrower, my federal student loan records are classified as protected education records under FERPA. Unauthorized access, review, or disclosure of my financial aid data without my written consent is a clear violation of 34 CFR 99.30 and constitutes a breach of privacy.\\n\\n2. Privacy Act of 1974 5 U.S.C. 552a As a federal loan servicer contracted by the U.S. Department of Education ( ED ), Nelnet is subject to the Privacy Acts provisions.

Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S.C. 16811681x If any financial data or records were accessed or viewed by an unauthorized entity without a permissible purpose, that is a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( f ) and subject to enforcement by the CFPB.\\n\\n5. Federal Information Security Modernization Act ( FISMA ) & OMB Circular A-130 As a federal contractor managing personally identifiable information ( PII ), Nelnet is required to adhere to the safeguards and audit procedures under FISMA and OMB Circular A-130. Your statement does not address whether security logs have been reviewed or if a breach report was filed with ED. \\n\\n\\n\\nFormal Demands Under Federal Law In accordance with FERPA, the Privacy Act, and other applicable statutes, I am demanding the following : 1.

Clarification of data retention practices, security measures, and breach notification protocols in line with 552a ( e ) ( 10 ). \\n4.

However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \\n\\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due.

Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due.

Unauthorized access or breach of personal data—mentioned in multiple complaints—increases the risk of identity theft or further privacy violations. When reportings are inaccurate or made without proper verification, borrowers face damage to credit scores and reputation, which are legally actionable.\\n\\n2. **Recurring Payment Processing Issues and Lack of Transparency:**  \\n   Complaints describe unauthorized changes to auto-debit amounts, placement of accounts into forbearance or delinquency without borrower initiation or consent, and difficulty accessing account information. These mismanagement practices can lead to unintentional missed payments, increased interest, and damage to credit. Lack of communication or transparency about account status exacerbates the risk, potentially resulting in default or unwarranted collection activity.\\n\\n3. **Risk of Fraud and Data Breaches:**  \\n   Alleged security lapses, including data breaches and unauthorized access (some complaints explicitly mention breaches violating FERPA and the Privacy Act), compromise borrower data. If NelNet’s role involves improper handling or security lapses, this can further harm borrowers through identity theft, unauthorized account changes, or disclosure of sensitive information—all of which are legally and financially damaging.\\n\\n4. **Legal Liability and Long-Term Financial Harm:**  \\n   - Inaccurate credit reports, especially when due to misreporting or unverified information, can cause long-term credit damage, making it harder for borrowers to secure mortgages, loans, or favorable interest rates.\\n   - Alleged violations of laws like the FCRA, FERPA, and the Privacy Act can lead to civil penalties and legal action against NelNet.\\n   - The alleged accounting and reporting inaccuracies, especially if they involve fraudulent or reckless misrepresentations (as some complaints suggest), can also lead to claims for damages from affected borrowers.\\n\\n**In summary:**\\nNelNet’s responsibilities as both a loan servicer and credit reporting agent create a conflict of interest and increase the risk of mismanagement, privacy violations, and inaccurate reporting. When combined with reportings of unauthorized account access, data breaches, and payment processing errors, borrowers face significant legal and financial threats, including credit score damage, potential identity theft, and violation of federal laws designed to protect consumer data and privacy.

This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \\n\\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \\n\\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case. There is no other correspondence available by either entity, nor any other correspondence sent to me.', 'XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Unit XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX United States XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year> Subject : Illegal Student Loan Reporting & Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment Complaint Against : - DEPTEDNELNET ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX | ( XXXX ) XXXX ) - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX To Whom It May Concern, I am filing a formal complaint against DEPTEDNELNET, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX  for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.\\n\\nComplaint Details : 1.

This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \\n\\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX.

Additionally, given the recent breaches and sale of servicing rights ( including issues involving Nelnet and publicized data breaches potentially connected to XXXX XXXX organizations ), I have serious concerns regarding the security and validity of my personal information and loan obligation. \\n\\nI formally request : Full verification and validation of any outstanding loan, including production of my original signed promissory note ; A complete chain of title demonstrating how the loan was legally transferred between entities ; Immediate cease of all collection activities until proper verification is provided ; Investigation into whether my data was compromised or sold without consent.\\n\\nIf verification can not be produced, I request the discharge or immediate removal of any related accounts from my credit reports, and the closure of any claims made against me.\\n\\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.', 'I am filing a formal complaint against the student loan servicing companies Aidvantage and XXXX regarding a suspected and highly plausible violation of my personal and educational data privacy rights.

While I have not been officially notified, the scale and nature of these privacy lapses make it entirely plausible that my information was compromised. I never gave written consent for my personal data to be shared with third parties for any purpose beyond the direct servicing of my loan.\\n\\nAs a result, I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter and support my demand for the full discharge of my federal student loans, as my privacy rights have been severely violated.', \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  I XXXX reached out to, XXXX ; XXXX and the loan carrier Aid vantage to clear Up an unidentified loan that was on my credit.

ISSUE : Lack of Verification of a Signed Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) Relevant Law : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), a credit reporting agency must conduct a reasonable reinvestigation if a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any item in their file. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), the CRA must ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information it includes. \\nDemand : I am demanding immediate deletion of the referenced student loan account ( s ) from my XXXX  credit file unless the data furnisher can provide the original, wet-ink signed Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) establishing a valid, enforceable obligation in my name. Electronic reproduction or summary data is not sufficient under federal evidentiary standards, particularly when the debt is disputed. The burden of proof lies with the furnisher. If the original contract does not exist, the tradeline must be removed. \\n\\n2. ISSUE : Failure to Verify Current Status Forbearance or Administrative Hold Relevant Law : Per 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ), the information furnisher is obligated to investigate disputed information and correct or delete any data found to be inaccurate or unverifiable. If a loan is in administrative forbearance, deferment, or a non-repayment status due to federal policy or executive order, such status must be clearly and accurately reflected in the reporting. Failure to do so constitutes willful misreporting and inaccurate furnishing of information. \\nDemand : Please verify whether this account is presently subject to administrative forbearance or any federal hold. If it is, it can not legally be reported as delinquent or in default. If this can not be fully verified and proven by the data furnisher, the account must be removed immediately for failure to meet accuracy and verification standards outlined by the FCRA. \\n\\n3. ISSUE : XXXX XXXX and XXXX  Compliance Failure Relevant Law : The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX  ) XXXX XXXX Format Guidelines, which XXXX has adopted for credit furnishing, require that all tradelines be accurate, complete, and up-to-date. Reporting disputed, unverifiable, or administratively frozen debts violates these guidelines. \\nDemand : You are required to remove any entry that does not conform with XXXX XXXX  and XXXX  standards. Student loans that are not contractually verified or are impacted by legislative changes ( such as federal repayment pauses or executive actions ) must not be reported as adverse. If you can not validate this account according to those standards, it must be removed. \\n\\nFailure to Comply Will Result in Further Action This is a legal dispute under the FCRA. Should you fail to respond within 30 days with sufficient documentation, I will escalate the matter with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and consider further legal action under 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o for willful or negligent noncompliance. \\n\\nSummary of Accounts to be Investigated and Deleted : Aidvantage / Account Number Ending in XXXX Aidvantage / Account Number Ending in XXXX  Enclosures : Copy of Photo ID Proof of Address ( Utility Bill or Bank Statement ) Copy of Credit Report Highlighting the Student Loan Accounts Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX .', 'This is my formal complaint against Aidvantage and the U.S. Department of Education regarding their failure to validate an alleged federal student loan debt.\\n\\nDespite multiple disputes and certified mailings, Aidvantage has failed to provide legally sufficient documentation.

For instance, reports of delinquencies during periods protected by forbearance or executive orders, or accounts opened without borrower consent, indicate inaccurate reporting.\\n\\n2. **Failure to Verify or Properly Document Debts:** Multiple complaints emphasize that aidVantage has failed to provide valid, legally sufficient documentation such as signed promissory notes, proof of transfer, or verification of debt legitimacy. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), furnishers are required to report accurate and verifiable information. Their inability or refusal to do so renders the tradeline unreliable.\\n\\n3. **Violation of Legal Protections and Procedural Errors:** Many reports cite violations of federal laws such as FCRA statutory requirements, the Privacy Act, and the ESIGN Act, especially concerning the lack of borrower consent, proper notification, or verification. Reports also mention that accounts were mishandled during legislative protections like the Department of Education’s abolishment or during forbearance periods, with no proper update or oversight.\\n\\n4. **Incorrect or Misleading Account Statuses:** Several complaints describe accounts marked as delinquent or defaulted without proper cause or notification, often during periods where no such status should have been reported, such as times of administrative forbearance or protected delay.\\n\\n5. **Potential Breach of Privacy and Data Security:** Complaints involve suspicion that sensitive borrower information was accessed, disclosed, or mishandled without consent, violating privacy laws, further undermining the credibility of the reporting entities.\\n\\n6. **Harm to Borrowers’ Credit and Civil Rights:** The reports articulate tangible harm, such as reduced credit scores, denied credit opportunities, foreclosures, or difficulty in transactions like home purchasing, all based on inaccurate tradelines. This underscores the unfair and deceptive nature of the reporting.\\n\\n**In summary**, these collective issues demonstrate that the tradeline contains inaccurate, unverifiable, or improperly handled information, which violates legal obligations for truthful reporting. These violations, combined with documented instances of miscommunication, lack of verification, and harm to the consumer, strongly substantiate a case for the removal of the tradeline from the credit report.', multi_responses=None, reference='The issues collectively support the argument for removal of the tradeline from the credit report as follows: First, the Department of Education loans were managed through AidVantage, with autopay set up and confirmed via email, yet the account still showed as past due without any notification that autopay was incomplete.

While I have not been officially notified, the scale and nature of these privacy lapses make it entirely plausible that my information was compromised. I never gave written consent for my personal data to be shared with third parties for any purpose beyond the direct servicing of my loan.\\n\\nAs a result, I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter and support my demand for the full discharge of my federal student loans, as my privacy rights have been severely violated.', 'XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Subject : FCRA Violation Dispute of Inaccurate Student Loan Reporting To Whom It May Concern, I am filing this formal complaint under the * * Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) * * regarding inaccurate information being reported on my credit file in connection with XXXX or more * * student loan accounts * *. \\n\\nThe account ( XXXX ) in question is/are being reported by : * * Loan Servicer/Creditor : * * DPT ED/AIDV AMOUNT OF {$28000.00} * * Account Number ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Bureau ( XXXX ) Reporting the Error XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Nature of the Complaint : - The reported information is * * inaccurate * *, * * outdated * *, or * * unverifiable * *. \\n- I have previously disputed this information with the credit reporting agencies, but it remains on my file. \\n- The servicer has failed to verify or correct the information as required by law. \\n- This is a violation of my rights under the * * FCRA * * and has negatively impacted my credit profile. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-', 'This is a formal legal demand for immediate investigation and permanent deletion of all student loan accounts reported under the tradeline \" DEPT OF XXXX, \\'\\' which is NELNET, XXXX my credit report.

This information includes the entirety of my student loan file, which is protected under longstanding federal privacy law and explicit contractual obligations governing the use, access, and safeguarding of this data. \\n\\nThe unauthorized access to my personal and financial records constitutes a direct violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), the Higher Education Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, among others. In addition, the Department of Education, by failing to prevent such a breach, has defaulted on its contractual duties, materially violating the terms of agreement I entered into as a borrower. As a matter of contract law, this breach voids the contract in its entirety, rendering all outstanding balances unenforceable. The contract is no longer valid and therefore all associated reporting must cease immediately. \\n\\nFurthermore, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), consumer reporting agencies are required to report only information that is complete and verifiable.

Continued furnishing or reinsertion of this information without legal justification or lawful verification constitutes willful noncompliance with federal law, making your agency liable under 15 U.S. Code 1681n and 1681o for civil damages. \\n\\nNelnet, the loan servicer responsible for these accounts, is equally liable for their role in the breach. As the originating furnisher of this erroneous and contractually voided data, Nelnet must immediately cease all furnishing of student loan information related to my name and render all associated accounts as deleted and paid in full, or otherwise indicate closure in good standing with XXXX balance due. It is unlawful and unconscionable to continue enforcing repayment obligations upon a client whose contractual terms have been breached by the government and its appointed agents.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 As a borrower, my federal student loan records are classified as protected education records under FERPA. Unauthorized access, review, or disclosure of my financial aid data without my written consent is a clear violation of 34 CFR 99.30 and constitutes a breach of privacy.\\n\\n2. Privacy Act of 1974 5 U.S.C. 552a As a federal loan servicer contracted by the U.S. Department of Education ( ED ), Nelnet is subject to the Privacy Acts provisions. The act mandates that all systems of records containing personal data be safeguarded against unauthorized access or disclosure. Your statement that consent is granted only when lawful and necessary lacks documentation showing compliance with 552a ( b ) and ( e ) ( 10 ). I request to review audit logs and security measures related to this data access.\\n\\n3. Breach of Contract I entered into a binding loan agreement with the reasonable expectation that Nelnet and the Department of Education would take all necessary steps to safeguard my sensitive data. Unauthorized accesswhether by internal actors, affiliates, or outside entities like XXXX XXXX XXXX as suspected ) constitutes a breach of fiduciary and contractual duty. \\n4. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S.C. 16811681x If any financial data or records were accessed or viewed by an unauthorized entity without a permissible purpose, that is a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( f ) and subject to enforcement by the CFPB.\\n\\n5. Federal Information Security Modernization Act ( FISMA ) & OMB Circular A-130 As a federal contractor managing personally identifiable information ( PII ), Nelnet is required to adhere to the safeguards and audit procedures under FISMA and OMB Circular A-130. Your statement does not address whether security logs have been reviewed or if a breach report was filed with ED. \\n\\n\\n\\nFormal Demands Under Federal Law In accordance with FERPA, the Privacy Act, and other applicable statutes, I am demanding the following : 1.

It documents a new, independently reportable violationspecifically, Aidvantages continued misrepresentation of a prior CFPB complaint filed against XXXX ( ID XXXX ) as the basis for its internal fraud classification, as well as its stated policy of collapsing multiple complaints into a single response record. \\n========================================================================= Any attempt by Aidvantage to mischaracterize this complaint as previously addressed or duplicative will be treated as a fraudulent procedural act and a misuse of the federal consumer complaint system, in violation of : 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) Prohibition on deceptive and abusive acts or practices ( UDAAP ) ; 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) Furnishers duty to correct and update inaccurate information ; D.C. Code 28-3904 ( e ), ( f ) Misrepresentation and failure to honor consumer rights under the D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act ; 18 U.S.C. 1001 Material false statements to a federal agency or in a matter within federal jurisdiction. \\n========================================================================= This complaint arises from a new, post-dated violation that took place after prior complaints were filed. It involves a materially false assertion made by Aidvantage in its XX/XX/2025 response, falsely linking a separate CFPB complaint ( filed against XXXX ) to its internal servicing records, and reaffirming a pattern of improper fraud designation and procedural concealment. \\n========================================================================= Furthermore, Aidvantages stated policy of responding to multiple complaints under one CFPB complaint number constitutes an attempt to suppress individualized complaint visibility, obstruct the official regulatory record, and evade accountability for ongoing and distinct legal violations. \\n========================================================================= Any further attempt by Aidvantage to mislabel this submission as duplicative or to suppress its factual and legal claims through internal aggregation policies will be preserved as evidence of regulatory misconduct and will be escalated as warranted. \\n========================================================================= NOTICE : Aidvantages continued misuse of the CFPBs complaint designation system to obscure procedural violations is being independently tracked as part of an active evidentiary dossier for potential regulatory enforcement and civil litigation, if warranted. \\n========================================================================= Subject : Systemic Misrepresentation by Aidvantage False Identity Theft Designation, Unauthorized Use of CFPB Complaint Record, and Violation of Federal Furnisher Obligations ========================================================================= To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, FTC ========================================================================= CC : Aidvantage Credit Bureau Management ========================================================================= Date : XX/XX/2025 ========================================================================= Complainant : XXXX XXXX XXXX ========================================================================= Complaint ID Referenced ( for background ) : ========================================================================= XXXX ========================================================================= XXXX ========================================================================= XXXX ========================================================================= XXXX ========================================================================= Affirmation of Independent Legal Action and Federal Record Accuracy ========================================================================= I submit this complaint in my individual legal capacity and affirm that I am not affiliated with any credit repair organization. This submission documents federal loan servicing misconduct and preserves all rights for civil, regulatory, and evidentiary enforcement. Aidvantage is formally on notice. \\n========================================================================= I. Unauthorized Identity Theft Designation of Federal Loan Account ========================================================================= Aidvantage unilaterally designated one or more of my federal student loan accounts as involving identity theft without my authorization, without law enforcement documentation, and without any identity theft report submitted by me. \\n========================================================================= This act constitutes : ========================================================================= A material misrepresentation of the status of a federal student loan, ========================================================================= A falsification of servicing records, ========================================================================= A violation of FCRA 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) and 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ( UDAAP ). \\n========================================================================= I have submitted a notarized affidavit and two FTC Fraud Reports affirming no identity theft was reported. Aidvantage proceeded with a fraud designation despite this documentation. \\n========================================================================= XXXX. Misuse of CFPB Complaint System to Justify Internal Fraud Protocol ========================================================================= In its XX/XX/2025 response, Aidvantage cited CFPB Complaint ID XXXX was filed against XXXX the basis for initiating a fraud classification on my federal loan. \\n========================================================================= This claim is demonstrably false. \\n========================================================================= The referenced complaint does not mention identity theft, was not submitted against Aidvantage, and was never intended as a fraud-related dispute. Aidvantages use of this record to trigger internal fraud protocols constitutes a misrepresentation in a federal proceeding and may violate : ========================================================================= 18 U.S.C. 1001 False statements to a federal agency, ========================================================================= 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 2 ) Misrepresentation to a consumer or regulator, ========================================================================= FCRA 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) Furnisher duty to correct inaccurate information. \\n========================================================================= III. Transmission or Attempted Transmission of False Identity Theft Information ========================================================================= Aidvantage has either transmitted or attempted to transmit this false identity theft classification to one or more consumer reporting agencies through E-Oscar or equivalent systems. \\n========================================================================= This conduct violates : ========================================================================= FCRA 1681e ( b ) Failure to ensure maximum possible accuracy, ========================================================================= 12 C.F.R. 1022.42 Accuracy and Integrity Rule under FACTA, ========================================================================= CFPB Bulletin 2014-01 Prohibition on furnishing misleading or false information. \\nXXXX Aidvantage has not produced documentation identifying the system or person responsible for triggering the fraud classification despite multiple formal requests. \\n========================================================================= IV. Procedural Suppression of the Official Regulatory Record ========================================================================= Aidvantages statement that multiple complaints regarding the same concerns will be responded to under one CFPB complaint number reflects a policy of collapsing distinct complaints to limit regulatory exposure. \\n========================================================================= This tactic obstructs the integrity of the Bureaus public complaint system. Each complaint filed documents new dates, new legal violations, and escalating conduct. Collapsing separate records may violate : ========================================================================= 12 U.S.C. 5495 CFPB coordination and supervisory authority requirements. \\n========================================================================= This behavior appears designed to evade systemic accountability for recurring violations. \\n========================================================================= V. Enforcement Referral and Legal Preservation ========================================================================= Pursuant to the Bureaus statutory mandate under 12 U.S.C. 5495 ( Coordination ), I formally request that this matter be referred for supervisory and enforcement review, and that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau coordinate with relevant federal and state agencies to ensure proper oversight, investigation, and legal remedy. \\n========================================================================= The following agency referrals are warranted based on distinct legal authorities, each directly implicated by Aidvantages conduct : ========================================================================= 1. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Enforcement Division ========================================================================= Aidvantages actions violate core provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, including : ========================================================================= o 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) : Duty of furnishers to correct and update inaccurate information.\\n\\n========================================================================= o 15 U.S.C. 1681i : Failure to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation upon notice of dispute.\\n\\n========================================================================= o 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) : Prohibition on deceptive or abusive acts or practices under the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( UDAAP ).\\n\\n========================================================================= These violations fall squarely within the CFPBs enforcement jurisdiction and implicate the agencys role in overseeing the accuracy and integrity of the credit reporting system.\\n\\n========================================================================= 2. Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) ========================================================================= Aidvantages repeated misrepresentations to both consumer and regulatorparticularly its misuse of an unrelated CFPB complaint to justify a false fraud designationviolate the Federal Trade Commission Act, specifically : ========================================================================= o 15 U.S.C. 45 ( a ) : Prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. \\n========================================================================= The FTC retains parallel jurisdiction over non-bank servicers and deceptive consumer-facing practices, and is positioned to investigate systemic misrepresentation or pattern violations. \\n========================================================================= 3. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) Civil Division, Consumer Protection Branch ========================================================================= Aidvantages conduct may constitute federal offenses under : ========================================================================= a. 18 U.S.C. 1001 : False statements in matters within the jurisdiction of a federal agency.\\n\\n========================================================================= b. 18 U.S.C. 1341 : Mail fraud, based on the use of USPS to transmit materially false information.\\n\\n========================================================================= c. 18 U.S.C. 1343 : Wire fraud, where electronic systems ( including CFPB portal and E-Oscar transmissions ) were used to perpetuate misrepresentations. \\n\\n========================================================================= DOJ is authorized to initiate both civil and criminal proceedings where false statements or fraudulent schemes affect federal records or regulatory systems. \\n========================================================================= 4. National Association of Attorneys General ( NAAG ) ========================================================================= Aidvantages conduct may violate multiple state-level consumer protection laws, including : ========================================================================= d. D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act ( CPPA ), D.C. Code 28-3904 ( e ), ( f ) : Prohibiting misrepresentation and omission of material facts in connection with consumer services. \\n\\n========================================================================= Given the multistate and federally regulated nature of the loan, a NAAG-coordinated review is appropriate under 5495s requirement for intergovernmental coordination to prevent regulatory evasion. \\n\\n\\n========================================================================= All factual assertions, sworn affidavits, and certified documents are preserved in accordance with the Federal Rules of Evidence 902 and 1005. No further burden-shifting, misclassification, or procedural obfuscation by Aidvantage will be accepted. This matter now requires cross-agency supervisory action. \\n========================================================================= Submitted by : XXXX XXXX XXXX', 'To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate and inconsistent reporting of my federal student loan balance across all three major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ). Despite my loan balance being in deferment, the balance has increased from approximately {$46000.00} to {$48000.00}, indicating that interest was improperly applied during this period.

Improper Accrual of Interest During Deferment My student loan has been in deferment, during which no interest should have accrued on a federally subsidized loan. \\nThe reported balance increase indicates a clear error, violating federal regulations governing student loan deferment. \\n2. Failure to Notify of Deferment Ending or Interest Accrual I never received any written or electronic notification that my student loans would exit deferment or that interest would begin accruing.\\n\\nThis failure to notify is a violation of the Higher Education Act of 1965, which mandates proper borrower notification.\\n\\n3. Unauthorized Disclosure and Mishandling of Personal Financial Information My personal financial information was compromised without my authorization, a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), 20 U.S.C. 1232g, 34 CFR Part 99. \\nAdditionally, the XXXX data breach exposed sensitive information of millions of consumers, including myself, further contributing to these inaccuracies. \\n\\nThe CFPB has ongoing litigation against XXXX and XXXX for systemic failures in protecting consumer data, including inaccuracies in credit reporting and mishandling sensitive information.

This is relevant because many of the complaints mention that student loan data has been reported or mishandled without proper verification, often violating laws like the FCRA (which mandates reasonable reinvestigation of disputes) and laws protecting privacy (FERPA, HIPAA).\\n\\n2. **Legal Violations and Law Violations Enforcement:**  \\n   Many disputes detail that student information was improperly accessed, disclosed, or mishandled without consent—violating FERPA, the Privacy Act of 1974, and possibly HIPAA. The CFPB's findings underscore the importance of proper legal compliance in investigations. For example, if credit bureaus or servicers fail to conduct proper investigations into disputes (such as alleged unauthorized data access), they may be violating the FCRA, which CFPB is actively enforcing.\\n\\n3. **Accountability for Data Breaches and Data Mishandling:**  \\n   The CFPB's enforcement actions serve as a warning that failing to properly investigate or verify data, especially when there are allegations of privacy violations, breaches, or unauthorized disclosures, can lead to serious legal consequences. The complaints that discuss data breaches, unauthorized disclosures, or mishandling of personally identifiable information (PII)—all breaches of FERPA and HIPAA—are directly implicated. The CFPB's findings reinforce the need for agencies and servicers to act lawfully and conduct thorough investigations.\\n\\n4. **Impact on Breach of Contract Claims:**  \\n   Many complaints involve breaches of contract and violations of privacy laws. The CFPB's role in ensuring investigations are fair and lawful supports consumers' claims that improper or unverified reporting, or mishandling of their data, breaches contractual obligations and legal rights. If a student loan provider or credit reporting agency fails to properly investigate disputes, especially those based on privacy breaches, that is a breach of their legal obligations and ownership standards under laws like the FCRA.\\n\\n5. **Legal and Regulatory Enforcement as a Remedy:**  \\n   The recent CFPB findings bolster consumers’ arguments that credit bureaus and student loan agencies must adhere to lawful investigation procedures, verify data accuracy, and respect privacy protections. They also underscore that violations can lead to enforcement actions, fines, or other remedies—aligning with consumers' requests for investigation, data deletion, and violations accountability discussed in these complaints.\\n\\n**In summary:**  \\nThe CFPB’s recent enforcement and findings about improper investigations for credit reporting agencies affirm that mishandling, unauthorized data access, and failure to properly investigate disputes—particularly those involving privacy violations under FERPA or HIPAA—constitute legal violations. These reinforce consumers' claims of breaches of contract and laws and highlight the importance of lawful investigations, verification, and data protection in student loan and credit reporting contexts.\", multi_responses=None, reference='The recent findings by the CFPB highlight that certain credit reporting agencies, such as XXXX and XXXX, failed to conduct proper and reasonable investigations into disputed credit report items, as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). This failure constitutes a violation of federal law and consumer protection standards. In the context of the student loan dispute, these CFPB findings are directly relevant because the borrower alleges not only FCRA violations but also breaches of contract and violations of rights under laws such as FERPA and HIPAA. The borrower asserts that these combined violations—improper investigations by credit bureaus (as identified by the CFPB), breaches of contract, and privacy law violations—justify the immediate removal, discharge, or forgiveness of the disputed student loan accounts from their credit report.', rubrics=None), synthesizer_name='multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer')]),\n",
